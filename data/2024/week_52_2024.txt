Title: Students wanted to postpone exams, sent bomb threats to their own schools: Delhi Police
Publication Date: Sun, 22 Dec 2024 10:12:52 +0000
Content: The Delhi Police revealed on Sunday that bomb threat emails sent to two schools in Rohini were sent by their own students. According to the police, the students sent the emails in an attempt to postpone their exams as they were unprepared.
“After an investigation by the Special Cell of Delhi Police, it was found that the emails were sent by two different students from the same school. Both students admitted to sending the emails to avoid their exams,” a Delhi Police official said.
“Since both were minors, they were counselled and released,” the police added.
On December 14, the Delhi Police Special Cell identified a student from a private school as the sender of a bomb threat email to a school in Paschim Vihar. Upon tracing the IP address, the police located the student’s home. During questioning, the student confessed to the act and was subsequently counselled. The police issued a warning to his parents to monitor his behaviour.
Between December 13 and 17, several schools in Delhi received bomb threat emails, with a total of 30 schools being targeted with hoax threats on December 13 alone.
On November 19, the Delhi High Court directed the Delhi government and police to devise a comprehensive action plan, including a detailed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), to handle bomb threats and related emergencies. The court set an eight-week deadline for implementing these measures.

Title: AI reveals hidden hazards of chemical mixtures in rivers: Study
Publication Date: Sun, 22 Dec 2024 10:11:50 +0000
Content: Artificial intelligence can provide significant insights into how complex chemical mixtures in rivers affect aquatic life, paving the way for more effective environmental protection.
A novel methodology developed by academics at the University of Birmingham demonstrates how advanced artificial intelligence (AI) approaches can help identify potentially harmful chemicals in rivers by monitoring their effects on small water fleas (Daphnia).
The team collaborated with scientists from the Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES) in China and the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) in Germany to analyze water samples from the Chaobai River system near Beijing. This river system is exposed to chemical pollutants from various sources, including agriculture, domestic use, and industry.
Professor John Colbourne, director of the University of Birmingham’s Centre for Environmental Research and Justice and a senior author of the paper, expressed optimism about the technology’s potential. He said:
“There is a vast array of chemicals in the environment. Water safety cannot be assessed one substance at a time. Now we have the means to monitor the totality of chemicals in environmental water samples to uncover unknown substances acting together to produce toxicity to animals, including humans.”
The results, published in Environmental Science and Technology, reveal that certain chemical mixtures can interact to impact critical biological processes in aquatic organisms, as indicated by changes in their genes. These chemical combinations create environmental hazards potentially greater than those posed by individual substances.
The research team used water fleas (Daphnia) as test organisms due to their sensitivity to water quality changes and their genetic similarities with other species, making them excellent indicators of environmental hazards.
“Our innovative approach leverages Daphnia as a sentinel species to uncover potential toxic substances in the environment,” explained Dr. Xiaojing Li of the University of Birmingham and the study’s lead author.
“By using AI methods, we can identify which subsets of chemicals might be particularly harmful to aquatic life, even at low concentrations that wouldn’t normally raise concerns.”
Dr. Jiarui Zhou, also at the University of Birmingham and co-first author, led the development of the AI algorithms. He said:
“Our approach demonstrates how advanced computational methods can help solve pressing environmental challenges. By analyzing vast amounts of biological and chemical data simultaneously, we can better understand and predict environmental risks.”
Professor Luisa Orsini, another senior author, emphasized the innovation in their methodology:
“The study’s key breakthrough lies in our data-driven, unbiased approach to uncovering how environmentally relevant concentrations of chemical mixtures can cause harm. This challenges conventional ecotoxicology and paves the way for regulatory adoption of the sentinel species Daphnia, alongside new methodological approaches.”
Dr. Timothy Williams, a co-author from the University of Birmingham, noted:
“Typically, aquatic toxicology studies either use high concentrations of individual chemicals to determine detailed biological responses or only measure apical effects, such as mortality and altered reproduction, after exposure to an environmental sample. This study breaks new ground by identifying key classes of chemicals affecting living organisms within genuine environmental mixtures at relatively low concentrations, while simultaneously characterizing the biomolecular changes they elicit.”

Title: Suspect in German Christmas market attack held on murder charges after night of grief, scuffles
Publication Date: Sun, 22 Dec 2024 10:06:19 +0000
Content: A man suspected of driving a car into a German Christmas market in an attack that killed at least five people and injured scores of others faces charges of murder and attempted murder, police said on Sunday, after the man was remanded in custody.
Police in the central city of Magdeburg where the attack happened on Friday also reported scuffles at a far-right demonstration attended by around 2,100 people on Saturday night, while other residents took part in sombre remembrance events.
The suspect is a 50-year-old man from Saudi Arabia who has lived in Germany for almost two decades.
A magistrate ordered the man, identified in German media as Taleb A., into pretrial custody after prosecutors pressed charges of murder on five counts, multiple counts of attempted murder and grievous bodily harm, according to a police statement.
It identified the dead as a nine-year-old boy and four adult women, aged 52, 45, 75 and 67.
German authorities have not named the suspect, who has permanent resident status in Germany, and media reports do not give his full name in keeping with local privacy laws.
Police reported scuffles at a protest attended by around 2,100 people on Saturday night, one day after the attack. Right-wingers had billed the gathering on messaging app Telegram as a “demonstration against terror”.
Protesters wearing black balaclavas could be seen holding a large banner with the word ‘remigration’, a term popular with far-right supporters seeking the mass deportation of migrants and people deemed not ethnically German.
The motive in Friday night’s attack remains unclear. Investigators are probing the suspect’s criticism of German authorities’ treatment of Saudi refugees, among other things. He was also a staunch critic of Islam and had voiced support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party on social media platform X.

Title: India’s forest cover increases by 1,445 square km, ISFR 2023 shows
Publication Date: Sun, 22 Dec 2024 09:04:48 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Bhupender Yadav, on Saturday released the ‘India State of Forest Report 2023’ (ISFR 2023) at the Forest Research Institute in Dehradun. This report, published biennially by the Forest Survey of India (FSI) since 1987, offers a comprehensive assessment of India’s forest and tree resources, based on satellite data and field-based surveys. The 2023 report marks the 18th edition of this significant publication.
The ISFR 2023 provides crucial information on the country’s forest cover, tree cover, mangrove cover, growing stock, carbon stock, and instances of forest fires. It also highlights the role of agroforestry in India. According to the latest assessment, the total forest and tree cover in India stands at 827,357 square kilometers, representing 25.17 percent of the country’s total geographical area. Of this, 715,343 square kilometers (21.76%) is classified as forest cover, while 112,014 square kilometers (3.41%) is tree cover.
Yadav expressed satisfaction over the increase in the country’s forest and tree cover, which has grown by 1,445 square kilometers since the 2021 assessment. This includes an increase of 156 square kilometers in forest cover and 1,289 square kilometers in tree cover. He also emphasized the advanced technology used by FSI for real-time fire alerts and forest fire services, which help in better forest management.
In terms of the top-performing states, Chhattisgarh led with an increase of 684 square kilometers in forest and tree cover, followed by Uttar Pradesh and Odisha, each with a 559 square kilometer increase, and Rajasthan, with a 394 square kilometer increase. Mizoram, Gujarat, and Odisha were the top three states showing the largest increase in forest cover, with Mizoram seeing an increase of 242 square kilometers, followed by Gujarat (180 square kilometers) and Odisha (152 square kilometers).
The report also provides a state-wise analysis of forest and tree cover, with Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, and Maharashtra leading in total area covered by forests and trees. Madhya Pradesh alone accounts for 85,724 square kilometers of forest and tree cover, while Arunachal Pradesh and Maharashtra follow with 67,083 and 65,383 square kilometers, respectively. In terms of forest cover relative to total geographical area, Lakshadweep (91.33%) has the highest percentage, followed by Mizoram (85.34%) and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands (81.62%).
The assessment also reveals that 19 states and union territories have more than 33 percent of their geographical area under forest cover, with eight states—Mizoram, Lakshadweep, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Manipur—boasting forest cover exceeding 75 percent.
In terms of other environmental resources, India’s mangrove cover is estimated at 4,992 square kilometers. The growing stock, which includes timber and other forest products, has increased by 262 million cubic meters compared to the previous assessment. Bamboo-bearing areas have also seen growth, with an increase of 5,227 square kilometers, reaching a total of 154,670 square kilometers. The potential annual timber production from trees outside forests has been estimated at 91.51 million cubic meters.
The carbon stock in India’s forests is another key highlight of the report. The current estimate stands at 7,285.5 million tonnes, marking an increase of 81.5 million tonnes from the last assessment. Furthermore, the report shows that India has already exceeded its carbon sequestration target under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), with a carbon stock of 30.43 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent, surpassing the 2.29 billion tonnes of additional carbon sink goal set for 2030.
The ISFR 2023 not only offers valuable insights into the health of India’s forests but also serves as a vital resource for policymakers, environmental planners, state forest departments, research organizations, and academic institutions. It provides essential data that aids in the conservation and sustainable management of the country’s natural resources.

Title: Atletico go top as late Sorloth goal earns dramatic 2-1 win at Barcelona
Publication Date: Sun, 22 Dec 2024 05:08:37 +0000
Content: Alexander Sorloth struck deep in stoppage time to hand Atletico Madrid a 2-1 comeback win at Barcelona on Saturday that moved them top of LaLiga with their 12th consecutive victory across all competitions.
Pedri put the hosts ahead in the first half but Rodrigo De Paul levelled after the break before Sorloth inflicted a third straight home league defeat on Barca and knocked them off the LaLiga summit.
It was Atletico’s first away win at Barcelona in 18 years and they now have 41 points with a game in hand, three ahead of the Catalans who have gone three league games without a win.
“It’s very tough. We had chances to seal the win. If you don’t put the game to bed, this happens,” Pedri told Movistar.
“Our home is where it has to be difficult to beat us. We have to improve a lot. We have to reset ourselves mentally and physically.”
Barca were the better side in the opening exchanges and Pedri scored on the half-hour mark following a great run into the box and a one-two with Gavi, beating goalkeeper Jan Oblak with a low shot.
Despite their dominance, the hosts were unable to extend their lead after the break as Raphinha’s chip hit the crossbar and Oblak blocked Fermin Lopez’s close-range shot with his feet.
Robert Lewandowski also failed to find the net as his poor shot from inside the six-yard box was also saved by Oblak.
De Paul then grabbed the equaliser in the 60th minute, capitalising on a poor clearance by Marc Casado on the edge of the box to slot his shot into the bottom corner with what was only Atletico’s second attempt on goal in the game.
“When you suffer more, you enjoy it more. We were up against a great rival. It had been many years since Atletico had won here, and we were also playing for the top spot,” De Paul said.
“It’s exciting to be leaders. It’s a huge satisfaction. When your work pays off, you feel completely satisfied. It’s an honour to wear this shirt, and when things go well it gives me great joy.”
Oblak pulled off a couple of key saves to deny Raphinha and Pedri before substitute Sorloth netted with a first-time effort six minutes into stoppage time from a deep cross by Nahuel Molina.
“I hadn’t won in Barcelona since I arrived, finally. It was difficult, but we got three points. Let’s continue in this vein,” Oblak said.
“We started badly, with some fear that nobody understands, because we are in very good shape. After the 1-0 we were able to hold on without conceding the second.
“The league is very long. Today is not key, it’s three points and there are a lot of points left. A month and a half ago we were far away and now we are here.”

Title: Rozgar Mela: PM Modi stresses modern education and employment opportunities for youth, women
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 07:24:54 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized the need for a robust and modern education system to harness the potential of the country’s youth, during the distribution of 71,000 appointment letters to newly recruited personnel on Monday. Highlighting the transformative impact of the National Education Policy (NEP), he outlined how it is paving the way for building a “New India.”
“To take the country forward, it is essential to nurture the potential of youth talent. This responsibility lies with the country’s education system,” the Prime Minister said, adding that the NEP addresses long-standing challenges and introduces greater flexibility. “Earlier, due to various restrictions, the education system became a burden on students. Now, it offers them new options,” he remarked.
The Prime Minister further pointed out how linguistic barriers once hindered opportunities for youth, particularly from rural, Dalit, backward, and tribal communities. In response, his government introduced measures like teaching in mother tongues and conducting exams in regional languages. Recruitment exams are now available in 13 languages, and targeted initiatives are underway, such as special recruitment rallies in border areas. Over 50,000 youths have already received appointment letters in the Central Armed Police Forces through these efforts.
The Prime Minister detailed the government’s initiatives to create employment in rural areas, particularly in the agriculture sector. Efforts such as the Gobardhan Yojana, which established Gobar Gas plants nationwide, have generated numerous jobs while producing clean energy. Similarly, linking agricultural markets to the e-NAM platform and increasing ethanol blending in fuel to 20% have not only supported farmers but also created additional employment in associated industries.
PM Modi also underscored his government’s focus on empowering women across all sectors. He highlighted the provision of appointment letters to thousands of women recruits as a step toward making them more self-reliant.
“Our efforts are aimed at removing every barrier that hinders women’s progress. Initiatives such as extending maternity leave to 26 weeks, building toilets in schools under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, and opening Jan Dhan accounts for 30 crore women have been transformative,” the Prime Minister said. He also mentioned the ‘Mudra Yojana,’ which offers collateral-free loans to women, and noted that most homes built under the PM Awas Yojana are registered in women’s names.

Title: PM Modi distributes 71,000 appointment letters to newly appointed recruits, says, “Development of country happens through its youth”
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 06:33:41 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday distributed over 71,000 appointment letters to newly appointed recruits via video conferencing.
The event was part of the Centre’s Rozgar Mela initiative, designed to empower youth by creating job opportunities and encouraging their active participation in nation-building.
In his address, PM Modi shared his recent experience in Kuwait, where he concluded a two-day visit on Sunday. During the trip, he had the opportunity to engage with young Indian professionals working there.
“I had several insightful discussions with India’s youth in Kuwait. Upon returning, my first program is with the youth of the country. I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the newly appointed recruits and their families,” he said.
PM Modi emphasized that harnessing the potential and talent of India’s youth remains the government’s top priority.
“Through Rozgar Mela, we are working continuously to create job opportunities. Over the last decade, various ministries, departments, and institutions have been running campaigns to offer government jobs. Today alone, more than 71,000 young people have been appointed. In the past 1.5 years, our government has provided permanent government jobs to nearly 10 lakh youth, setting a remarkable record,” he said.
PM Modi contrasted this with previous administrations, highlighting the lack of similar large-scale efforts to provide permanent government jobs.
“Unlike in the past, where such initiatives didn’t exist in mission mode, today millions of youth are receiving jobs through a system that is both transparent and fair,” PM Modi said.
Stressing the critical role of youth in nation-building, the Prime Minister said, “The strength and leadership of our youth are central to India’s development. We have all taken a pledge to build a developed India by 2047, and this vision is grounded in the talent of our youth. Over the past decade, initiatives like Make in India, Atmanirbhar Bharat, Startup India, Standup India, and Digital India have all been designed with young people at their core. India has transformed its policies in areas like space exploration and defence manufacturing, and the youth have been the biggest beneficiaries.”
PM Modi also highlighted the government’s commitment to providing comprehensive support to young people in their pursuits.
“Today, when a young person starts a business, they are met with an entire ecosystem that supports their growth. Those pursuing careers in sports do so with the confidence that they will succeed. India is now the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world, and across sectors—from renewable energy to organic farming, space exploration to defence, tourism to wellness—India is scaling new heights,” he added.
Invoking Chaudhary Charan Singh’s legacy on ‘Kisan Diwas,’ PM Modi underscored the Centre’s ongoing efforts toward rural development and farmer upliftment.
He highlighted employment-focused initiatives such as Bima Suraksha, Lakhpati Didi, and Drone Didi, which are aimed at empowering rural communities and supporting farmers.
He also lauded the participation of women in the Rozgar Mela, saying, “Today, many women have received their appointment letters. I hope they inspire others. Schemes such as Sukanya Samruddhi Yojana, Jan Dhan Bank accounts, and Mudra Yojana enable women to pursue education without financial worries.”
The Prime Minister also mentioned that under the PM Awas Yojana, maximum houses are under the name of women.
The Rozgar Mela is being held across 45 locations nationwide, recruiting for various ministries and departments, including the Ministry of Home Affairs, Department of Posts, Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and the Department of Financial Services.
According to a government release, the Rozgar Mela aligns with the Prime Minister’s commitment to job creation, providing meaningful opportunities for youth to contribute to nation-building and achieve self-empowerment.

Title: Netanyahu says Israel will continue to act against the Houthis
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 06:27:36 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday Israel would continue acting against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, whom he accused of threatening world shipping and the international order, and called on Israelis to be steadfast.
“Just as we acted forcefully against the terrorist arms of Iran’s axis of evil, so we will act against the Houthis,” he said in a video statement a day after a missile fired from Yemen fell in the Tel Aviv area, causing a number of mild injuries.
On Thursday, Israeli jets launched a series of strikes against energy and port infrastructure in Yemen in a move officials said was a response to hundreds of missile and drone attacks launched by the Houthis since the start of the Gaza war 14 months ago.
On Saturday, the U.S. military said it conducted precision airstrikes against a missile storage facility and a command-and-control facility operated by Houthis in Yemen’s capital, Sanaa.
Netanyahu, strengthened at home by the Israeli military’s campaign against Iran-backed Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon and by its destruction of most of the Syrian army’s strategic weapons, said Israel would act with the United States.
“Therefore, we will act with strength, determination and sophistication. I tell you that even if it takes time, the result will be the same,” he said.
The Houthis have launched repeated attacks on international shipping in waters near Yemen since November 2023, in support of the Palestinians over Israel’s war with Hamas.

Title: Trump says it could be worth keeping TikTok in US for a little while
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 06:08:36 +0000
Content: President-elect Donald Trump indicated on Sunday that he favored allowing TikTok to keep operating in the United States for at least a little while, saying he had received billions of views on the social media platform during his presidential campaign.
Trump’s comments before a crowd of conservative supporters in Phoenix, Arizona, were one of the strongest signals yet that he opposes a potential exit of TikTok from the U.S. market.
The U.S. Senate passed a law in April requiring TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest the app, citing national security concerns.
TikTok’s owners have sought to have the law struck down, and the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case. But if the court does not rule in ByteDance’s favor and no divestment occurs, the app could be effectively banned in the United States on Jan. 19, one day before Trump takes office.
It is unclear how Trump would go about undoing the TikTok divestiture order, which passed overwhelmingly in the Senate.
“I think we’re going to have to start thinking because, you know, we did go on TikTok, and we had a great response with billions of views, billions and billions of views,” Trump told the crowd at AmericaFest, an annual gathering organized by conservative group Turning Point.
“They brought me a chart, and it was a record, and it was so beautiful to see, and as I looked at it, I said, ‘Maybe we gotta keep this sucker around for a little while’,” he said.
Trump met with TikTok’s CEO on Monday. Trump said at a news conference the same day that he had a “warm spot” for TikTok thanks to his campaign’s success on the app.
The Justice Department has argued that Chinese control of TikTok poses a continuing threat to national security, a position supported by most U.S. lawmakers.
TikTok says the Justice Department has misstated the social media app’s ties to China, arguing that its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in the United States on cloud servers operated by Oracle Corp, while content moderation decisions that affect U.S. users are made in the United States.

Title: Foreign Secretary Misri reaffirms deepening of India-Mauritius ties during visit to the nation
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 05:43:04 +0000
Content: Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri concluded his first official visit to Mauritius from December 20-22, strengthening the bilateral ties between India and Mauritius. This visit followed a congratulatory phone call from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Mauritius Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam on November 11, celebrating his victory in the parliamentary elections.
The visit underlines the importance India places on its relationship with Mauritius and is part of continued high-level engagements between the two countries. It reflects India’s commitment to its “Neighbourhood First,” “Vision Sagar,” and “Africa Forward” policies, as well as its broader commitment to the Global South. Both nations reaffirmed their dedication to deepening their multi-dimensional partnership, aimed at fostering prosperity and development not only for the two countries but also for the wider Indian Ocean Region.
During his meeting with Prime Minister Ramgoolam, Foreign Secretary Misri congratulated him on his electoral success and extended an invitation from Prime Minister Modi for Ramgoolam to visit India. The two leaders discussed a wide range of bilateral issues and explored ways to strengthen the unique and close partnership between the two nations. Misri reaffirmed India’s ongoing commitment to Mauritius’ development and prosperity.
A significant moment during the visit was Misri’s trip to Aapravasi Ghat, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Mauritius that symbolizes the historic ties between India and Mauritius. Misri also visited key infrastructure projects funded by India, including the Civil Service College and an Area Health Centre in Cap Malheureux, underscoring India’s role in supporting Mauritius’ development.
In addition to meeting with Prime Minister Ramgoolam, Foreign Secretary Misri called on other high-ranking officials, including President Dharambeer Gokhool, Deputy Prime Minister Paul Berenger, and Foreign Minister Dhananjay Ramful. The Foreign Secretary also engaged with senior Mauritian leaders and officials, strengthening diplomatic ties further.

Title: Soccer-Liverpool hit Tottenham for six to cement top spot, Chelsea held
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 05:33:20 +0000
Content: Liverpool strengthened their hold on the Premier League top spot with an extraordinary 6-3 victory at battered Tottenham Hotspur after second-placed Chelsea were held to a frustrating 0-0 draw away to Everton on Sunday.
Mohamed Salah scored twice, as did Luis Diaz, while Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai were also on target at bamboozled Spurs for Dutchman Arne Slot’s Liverpool side who head into Christmas four points clear.
Chelsea could have gone into first place before Liverpool’s clash in north London but failed to make it nine straight wins in all competitions as Everton dug deep to earn a point at Goodison Park.
Liverpool have 39 points from 16 games with Chelsea on 35 having played a game more. Arsenal, who won 5-1 at Crystal Palace on Saturday, have 33 points from 17 games.
Bottom club Southampton’s 0-0 draw at Fulham on Sunday means reigning champions Manchester City are now the worst performing Premier League team since the start of November after a 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa on Saturday left them down in seventh.
Manchester United suffered a humiliating 3-0 loss at home to Bournemouth on Sunday as the south coast club moved up to fifth, while Wolverhampton Wanderers won 3-0 at Leicester City in Vitor Pereira’s first game in charge.
Raining Goals
Tottenham’s last three home games in all competitions have now provided 23 goals as their wide-open style was ruthlessly punished by a razor-sharp Liverpool.
Diaz met Trent Alexander-Arnold’s beautiful cross with a diving header to open the scoring before Alexis Mac Allister nodded home from close range to double Liverpool’s lead.
James Maddison pulled one back for Spurs in the 41st minute but Dominik Szoboszlai restored the visitors’ two-goal lead before the break as he slotted past Fraser Forster following a counter-attack.
Salah’s double came in seven second-half minutes to take his league tally this season to 15 before Tottenham hit back with Dejan Kulusevski’s volley and Dominic Solanke’s effort in the 83rd that threatened to set up a frantic finale. But Diaz settled any Liverpool jitters with his second goal of the game.
Liverpool’s emphatic win means only one of the weekend’s Premier League games ended in a home victory.
“We expected that (a chaotic game), the way they play, they open the game, they enjoy their football, physically tough and mentally we always have to be in the game,” Salah, whose two assists took his total for the season to 11, told Sky Sports.
Salah is the first player to reach double figures for both goals and assists before Christmas in a Premier League season.
Maresca Happy
The closest Chelsea came to piercing Everton’s armour was a Nicolas Jackson shot against the post in the first half but while it proved a frustrating day for Enzo Maresca’s side the Italian remained upbeat.
“That was a real game,” he said. “I’m very happy because the performance of the boys was fantastic. Sometimes you have to play a different game and we’re learning to play a different game. Everton are one of the best teams in Europe in terms of clean sheets.”
The Toffees kept a fifth clean sheet in six games.
Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim said “nothing bad lasts forever” after his side’s 3-0 drubbing at Old Trafford, a defeat that came three days after they were beaten 4-3 at Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup quarter-finals.
“We just need to work on the way we play, that’s all,” the Portuguese, whose side are in 13th place, said. “Focus on the job in the moment, not what you feel in the stadium.”
Goals by Dean Huijsen, Justin Kluivert and Antoine Semenyo put high-flying Bournemouth into the Europa League qualifying spot and means United will spend Christmas in the bottom half of the table for the first time in Premier League history.
Wolves moved up a place to 18th, two points short of the safety zone, with Goncalo Guedes, Rodrigo Gomes and Matheus Cunha all on target against Ruud van Nistelrooy’s Leicester — the perfect start for Pereira.
“I believe that we will stay in the Premier League and we will play at a better level than we saw today. Today I am happy as the team showed spirit and the spirit that Wolves supporters want to see,” said the Portuguese, who replaced Gary O’Neil.

Title: Three Khalistani terrorists who bombed Punjab Police posts killed in encounter in UP
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 05:01:23 +0000
Content: Three suspects accused of throwing a grenade at police posts in Punjab’s Gurdaspur were killed in a police encounter in Uttar Pradesh’s Pilibhit early Monday morning, a senior police officer said.
Punjab Police DGP Gaurav Yadav, while sharing details on the social media platform X, said, “In a major breakthrough against a Pak-sponsored Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) terror module, a joint operation by UP Police and Punjab Police led to an encounter with three module members who fired at the police party.”
He added, “This terror module is involved in grenade attacks at police establishments in border areas of Punjab.”
He said that the three suspects were involved in the grenade attack on a police post in Gurdaspur.
Pilibhit Superintendent of Police (SP) Avinash Pandey reported that the gunfight occurred in the Puranpur police station area between the suspected Khalistani terrorists and a joint team of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh Police.
The injured suspects, identified as Gurvinder Singh, Virendra Singh, and Jasanpreet Singh, sustained injuries and were taken to a hospital for treatment.
Authorities recovered two AK-series rifles, two Glock pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the scene.
“Early this morning, a team from Punjab Police informed Puranpur police station that suspects in a grenade attack on a police post by alleged Khalistani terrorists might be hiding in the area,” SP Pandey said.
Upon receiving this information, police teams immediately launched a blockade and searched the area.
They later received a tip-off about three suspicious young men on a motorcycle, riding dangerously and carrying potentially harmful items, heading toward Pilibhit.
“Both Punjab Police and Puranpur police station staff chased the suspects. Meanwhile, Gajrola and Madhav Thanda police stations were alerted about possible escape routes,” he said.
“At a canal track near an under-construction bridge, the suspects opened fire when challenged by the police. In the retaliatory firing, all three were injured and subsequently sent to CSC Puranpur for treatment,” Pandey added.
However, they later succumbed to the injuries.
Recently, multiple explosions targeted police posts in Gurdaspur. On Thursday, a grenade was hurled at the closed Bakshiwal police post.
A day later, another explosion occurred at the closed Wadala Bangar police post, which had also recently shut down due to staff shortages.
Residents in nearby areas reported being shaken by the blasts.
At Wadala Bangar, frightened locals emerged from their homes at night only to discover the sound originated from the police station. Following the explosion, police vehicles patrolled the area throughout the night, with sirens blaring.

Title: Young mammoth remains found nearly intact in Siberian permafrost
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:59:36 +0000
Content: Researchers in Siberia are conducting tests on a juvenile mammoth whose remarkably well-preserved remains were discovered in thawing permafrost after more than 50,000 years.
The creature, resembling a small elephant with a trunk, was recovered from the Batagaika crater, a huge depression more than 80 metres (260 feet) deep which is widening as a result of climate change.
The carcass, weighing more than 110 kg (240 pounds), was brought to the surface on an improvised stretcher, said Maxim Cherpasov, head of the Lazarev Mammoth Museum Laboratory in the city of Yakutsk.
He said the mammoth was probably a little over a year old when it died, but tests would enable the scientists to confirm this more accurately. The fact that its head and trunk had survived was particularly unusual.
“As a rule, the part that thaws out first, especially the trunk, is often eaten by modern predators or birds. Here, for example, even though the forelimbs have already been eaten, the head is remarkably well preserved,” Cherpasov told Reuters.
It is the latest of a series of spectacular discoveries in the Russian permafrost. Last month, scientists in the same vast northeastern region – known as Sakha or Yakutia – showed off the 32,000-year-old remains of a tiny sabre-toothed cat cub, while earlier this year a 44,000-year-old wolf carcass was uncovered.

Title: Bangladesh requests India to return ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:47:38 +0000
Content: Bangladesh has formally requested India to send back former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India following her ousting on August 5 after a student-led movement.
The request was made through a “note verbale” to the Indian government, according to Touhid Hossain, the Foreign Affairs Adviser of Bangladesh’s Interim government, as reported by local media outlets. Hossain confirmed the submission of the note verbale, seeking the return of the 76-year-old leader.
Hasina, who had been in power for over a decade, was removed from office after weeks of student-led protests and violent clashes that resulted in over 600 deaths. In the wake of her ouster, she fled to India, and a new interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus was established in Bangladesh.
In a recent statement made on December 9, Hasina accused Yunus, the Chief Adviser to the interim government, of orchestrating the student protests that led to her removal. She described the protests as a “meticulously designed” effort to topple her administration.
Speaking at a virtual meeting of the United Kingdom Awami League, Hasina claimed that despite the demands of the protesters being met, unrest continued, implying a deeper conspiracy to remove her from power.
Hasina specifically pointed to Yunus, accusing him of being the “mastermind” behind the protests that started on July 7, 2024. She argued that the protests, which she claims were not student-initiated, were part of a well-planned strategy to remove her from office, even after her government addressed the protesters’ demands.
The ousted leader also voiced criticism against the interim government’s actions, describing it as “fascist” and accusing it of depriving the people of Bangladesh of their fundamental rights. She said, “Today, Bangladesh is going through a tough time. Under a fascist government, the people of Bangladesh have been deprived of their rights. The whole of Bangladesh is burning… Today, Bangladesh is being destroyed.”
Hasina also referenced the arrest of former ISKCON priest Chinmoy Krishna Das, who was detained on alleged sedition charges. She criticized the government for preventing Das from having legal representation, calling it a glaring example of the country’s deteriorating justice system.
“They arrested Chinmoy Krishna Das and said there couldn’t be any kind of lawyer defending him. What kind of justice is this?…This proves that Bangladesh doesn’t have law and order,” she added.

Title: Some gaps have narrowed in elusive Gaza ceasefire deal, sides say
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:34:02 +0000
Content: Gaps between Israel and Hamas over a possible Gaza ceasefire have narrowed, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials’ remarks on Monday, though crucial differences have yet to be resolved.
A fresh bid by mediators Egypt, Qatar and the United States to end the fighting and release Israeli and foreign hostages has gained momentum this month, though no breakthrough has yet been reported.
A Palestinian official familiar with the talks said while some sticking points had been resolved, the identity of some of the Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel in return for hostages had yet to be agreed, along with the precise deployment of Israeli troops in Gaza.
His remarks corresponded with comments by the Israeli diaspora minister, Amichai Chikli, who said both issues were still being negotiated. Nonetheless, he said, the sides were far closer to reaching agreement than they have been for months.
“This ceasefire can last six months or it can last 10 years, it depends on the dynamics that will form on the ground,” Chikli told Israel’s Kan radio. 
Much hinged on what powers would be running and rehabilitating Gaza once fighting stopped, he said.
The duration of the ceasefire has been a fundamental sticking point throughout several rounds of failed negotiations. Hamas wants an end to the war, while Israel wants an end to Hamas’ rule of Gaza first.
“The issue of ending the war completely hasn’t yet been resolved,” said the Palestinian official.
Israeli minister Zeev Elkin, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet, told Israel’s Army Radio that the aim was to find an agreed framework that would resolve that difference during a second stage of the ceasefire deal.
Chikli said the first stage would be a humanitarian phase that will last 42 days and include a hostage release.
Hospital

The war was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.
Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza has since killed more than 45,200 Palestinians, according to health officials in the Hamas-run enclave. 
Most of the population of 2.3 million has been displaced and much of Gaza is in ruins. At least 11 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes on Monday, medics said.
One of Gaza’s few still partially functioning hospitals, on its northern edge, an area under intense Israeli military pressure for nearly three months, sought urgent help after being hit by Israeli fire.
“We are facing a continuous daily threat,” said Hussam Abu Safiya, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital. 
“The bombing continues from all directions, affecting the building, the departments, and the staff.”
The Israeli military did not immediately comment. On Sunday it said it was supplying fuel and food to the hospital and helping evacuate some patients and staff to safer areas.
Palestinians accuse Israel of seeking to permanently depopulate northern Gaza to create a buffer zone, which Israel denies.
Israel says its operation around the three communities on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip – Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia – is targeting Hamas militants.
On Monday, the United Nations’ aid chief, Tom Fletcher, said Israeli forces had hampered efforts to deliver much needed aid in northern Gaza.
“North Gaza has been under a near-total siege for more than two months, raising the spectre of famine,” he said. 
“South Gaza is extremely overcrowded, creating horrific living conditions and even greater humanitarian needs as winter sets in.”

Title: Stock market gains nearly 500 points amid positive global cues
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:23:35 +0000
Content: After a week of losses, Indian equity markets closed on a positive note on Monday, buoyed by strong global cues. The domestic benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty, rebounded after witnessing a near 5% decline over the past five consecutive trading sessions.
Realty and PSU bank stocks led the rally in the Nifty, driving the market upwards.
At the close, the Sensex settled at 78,540.17, marking a gain of 498.58 points or 0.64%, while the Nifty ended at 23,753.45, up 165.95 points or 0.70%.
The Nifty Bank index climbed 558.40 points, or 1.10%, to close at 51,317.60. The Nifty Midcap 100 index rose by 186.15 points or 0.33%, ending at 57,092.90. However, the Nifty Smallcap 100 index declined slightly, losing 26.50 points or 0.14% to close at 18,687.80.
V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, pointed out that short-term market recoveries may continue but could face renewed pressure from Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) selling.
“In the short run, there will be market rebounds, which may be followed by renewed FII selling. A sustained rally is possible only when we see clear signs of economic growth revival, likely in early 2025,” he said.
Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, attributed the optimism to improved global data and positive sentiment in interest rate-sensitive sectors.
“The lower-than-expected US PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) data boosted investor confidence, particularly in metals, which benefited from expectations of higher steel import taxes. However, the short-term outlook remains sideways due to a lack of fresh catalysts and the impact of the festive season,” he said.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), 1,640 shares advanced, while 2,445 declined, and 133 remained unchanged.
Sectorally, most indices ended in green, with realty and PSU banks gaining the most. However, Auto, Media, and Healthcare sectors recorded minor losses.
In the Sensex pack, top gainers included ITC, Tech Mahindra, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, Titan, SBI, ICICI Bank, Adani Ports, Tata Steel, and Bharti Airtel. On the other hand, Zomato, Maruti, Nestle India, HCL Tech, and Bajaj Finserv were among the top losers.
Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) sold equities worth ₹3,597.82 crore on December 20, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) purchased equities worth ₹1,374.37 crore on the same day.
Earlier in the session, the Indian stock market jumped over 600 points amid mixed but largely positive global cues, signaling renewed optimism among investors.

Title: National Consumer Day 2024: Union Minister Pralhad Joshi to launch key initiatives to boost consumer protection
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:20:36 +0000
Content: Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution, Pralhad Joshi, will chair the National Consumer Day celebration in New Delhi on Tuesday.
This year’s theme, “Virtual Hearings & Digital Access to Consumer Justice,” aligns with efforts to enhance consumer protection in an increasingly digital world.
Key initiatives will be launched during the event to protect consumers and promote transparency across sectors.
Thirteen leading e-commerce companies, including platforms from Reliance Retail, Tata Sons, Zomato, and Swiggy, will sign a Safety Pledge, a voluntary public commitment to ensure the safety of goods sold online and uphold consumer rights.
This pledge was developed after extensive consultation with stakeholders and aims to strengthen consumer protection in e-commerce, adhering to global best practices.
New Digital Tools for Consumer Protection
The event will also witness the launch of new digital tools to safeguard consumers from deceptive online practices, including the ‘Jago Grahak Jago App,’ ‘Jagriti App,’ and ‘Jagriti Dashboard.’ These tools will help detect and report “dark patterns” in e-commerce that manipulate consumer behaviour.
The AI-powered apps and dashboard will alert users to unsafe URLs and allow consumers to report suspicious activities directly to the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA).
Additionally, the ‘e-Maap’ portal, a unified digital platform for all Legal Metrology services, will be introduced. It aims to streamline processes such as licensing and verification, reducing the compliance burden for businesses while promoting transparency and protecting consumer rights.

Title: Inflation burden eases for farm and rural labourers
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:11:43 +0000
Content: The All-India Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL) and Rural Labourers (CPI-RL) for November this year declined to 5.35 per cent and 5.47 per cent respectively, compared to 7.37 per cent and 7.13 per cent in the same month last year, according to figures released by the Ministry of Labour and Employment on Monday.
The inflation for agricultural and rural labourers for November was also lower than the corresponding figures for October 2024 at 5.96 per cent for CPI-AL and 6.00 per cent for CPI-RL. This is the second consecutive month of slowing inflation as the figures for retail inflation in October were lower than September.
The easing of the inflation burden for both agricultural and rural labourers comes as a welcome relief for these vulnerable segments that are hit hardest by spiralling prices. It also leaves more money in their hands to buy a wider range of goods, leading to a better lifestyle.
The decline also comes in the backdrop of India’s retail price inflation based on the CPI index declining to 5.48 per cent in November as the increase in prices of food items eased during the month bringing relief to household budgets, figures released earlier this month showed.
The slowing inflation marks a reversal of the increasing trend in the previous two months when the inflation rate touched 6.21 per cent in October.
During November, a significant decline in inflation was observed in vegetables, pulses, sugar and confectionery, fruits, eggs, milk and products, spices, transport and communication subgroups, according to the official statement.
The easing in inflation is a welcome sign as it was the first time that the rate of retail inflation crossed the RBI’s upper limit of 6 per cent in October. The RBI is waiting for retail inflation to come down to 4 per cent on a durable basis before it can go in for an interest rate cut to propel growth.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) , in its latest monetary policy review slashed the cash reserve ratio (CRR) for banks by 0.5 per cent to make more funds available for lending to spur economic growth but kept the key policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent with an eye on inflation.
The CRR has been reduced from 4.5 per cent to 4 per cent which will infuse Rs 1.16 lakh crore into the banking system and bring down market interest rates.
The monetary policy decision maintains a delicate balance between controlling inflation and pushing up the growth rate in a slowing economy,
In his last monetary policy view, former RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said, “India’s growth story is still intact. Inflation is on the declining path, but we cannot overlook the significant risks in the outlook. This risk cannot be underestimated.”
He was optimistic about the outlook for the economy, observing that “the balance between inflation and growth is well poised.”

Title: What happens when Russian gas to Europe via Ukraine stops?
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:03:36 +0000
Content: Russian President Vladimir Putin met Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in the Kremlin on Sunday, a rare visit by a European Union leader to Moscow as a contract allowing for Russian gas to transit through Ukraine nears expiry.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said on Thursday that Kyiv could consider continued transit of Russian gas, but only on condition that Moscow did not receive payment until after the war – a condition it was unlikely to accept. Putin said that day that it was clear there would be no new deal with Kyiv to send Russian gas through Ukraine to Europe.
Here is what happens if Russian gas transit via Ukraine is completely turned off and whom will be affected most.
HOW BIG ARE THE VOLUMES?
Russian gas supplies to Europe via Ukraine are relatively small. Russia shipped about 15 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas via Ukraine in 2023 – only 8% of peak Russian gas flows to Europe via various routes in 2018-19.
Russia spent half a century building its European gas market share, which at its peak stood at 35%.
Moscow has lost its share to rivals such as Norway, the United States and Qatar since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which spurred the EU to cut its dependence on Russian gas.
EU gas prices rallied in 2022 to record highs after the loss of Russian supplies. The rally won’t be repeated given modest volumes and a small number of customers for the remaining volumes, according to EU officials and traders.
UKRAINIAN ROUTE
The Soviet-era Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod pipeline brings gas from Siberia via the town of Sudzha – which is now under control of Ukrainian military forces – in Russia’s Kursk region. It then flows through Ukraine to Slovakia.
In Slovakia, the gas pipeline splits into branches going to the Czech Republic and Austria.
Russia’s overall gas exports via the route have held steady despite the stoppage of flows from Gazprom to Austria’s OMV in mid-November over a contractual dispute, and legal wranglings as other buyers stepped in to buy the volumes.
Austria still receives most of its gas via Ukraine, while Russia accounts for around two-thirds of Hungary’s gas imports.
Slovakia takes around 3 bcm from energy giant Gazprom per year, also about two-thirds of its needs.
The Czech Republic almost completely cut gas imports from the east last year, but began taking gas from Russia in 2024.
Most other Russian gas routes to Europe are shut including Yamal-Europe via Belarus and Nord Stream under the Baltic.
The only other operational Russian gas pipeline route to Europe is the Blue Stream and TurkStream to Turkey under the Black Sea. Turkey sends some Russian gas volumes onward to Europe including to Hungary.
WHY DOES THE UKRAINIAN ROUTE STILL WORK?
While remaining Russian gas transit volumes are small, the issue remains a dilemma for the EU. Many EU members such as France and Germany have said they will not buy Russian gas anymore but the stance of Slovakia, Hungary and Austria, which have closer ties to Moscow, challenges the EU common approach.
The countries, who still receive Russian gas, argue it is the most economic fuel and also blame neighbouring EU countries for high transit fees imposed on alternative supplies.
Ukraine still earns $0.8-$1 billion in transit fees per year from Russian gas transit.
According to Reuters calculations, Gazprom’s total pipeline gas exports to Europe via all routes in 2024 have increased to 32 bcm from 28.3 bcm in 2023, when they collapsed to the lowest level since the 1970s.
Russia could earn around $5 billion on sales via Ukraine this year based on an average Russian government gas price forecast of $339 per 1,000 cubic metres, according to Reuters calculations.
Russia’s gas pipeline export monopoly Gazprom plunged to a net loss of $7 billion in 2023, its first annual loss since 1999, because of the loss of EU gas markets.
Russia has said it would be ready to extend the transit deal but Kyiv has repeatedly said it will not do it.
Another option is for Gazprom to supply some of the gas via another route, for example via TurkStream, Bulgaria, Serbia or Hungary. However, capacity via these routes is limited.
Hungary has been keen to keep the Ukrainian route open, but said it would continue to receive Russian gas from the south, via the TurkStream pipeline on the bed of the Black Sea.
The EU and Ukraine have also asked Azerbaijan to facilitate discussions with Russia regarding the gas transit deal.
A senior source at Azeri energy company SOCAR said on Friday that Moscow and Kyiv have failed to agree on the deal brokered by Azerbaijan to continue Russian gas exports to Europe via Ukraine.

Title: Biden launches new US trade probe into legacy Chinese chips
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 10:53:11 +0000
Content: The Biden administration on Monday announced a last-minute trade investigation into Chinese-made “legacy” semiconductors that could heap more U.S. tariffs on chips from China that power everyday goods from autos to washing machines to telecoms gear.
The “Section 301” probe, launched just four weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20, will be handed over to his administration in January for completion, Biden administration officials said.
The effort could offer Trump a ready avenue to begin imposing some of the hefty, 60% tariffs that he has threatened on Chinese imports.
Departing President Joe Biden has already imposed a 50% U.S. tariff on Chinese semiconductors that starts on Jan. 1. His administration has tightened export curbs on advanced AI and memory chips and chipmaking equipment to China and also recently increased tariffs to 50% on Chinese solar wafers and polysilicon.
The U.S. Trade Representative’s office, which will conduct the new probe, said it is aimed at protecting American and other market-driven chip producers from China’s massive state-driven buildup of domestic chip supply.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said that the trade agency has found evidence that Beijing is targeting the semiconductor industry for global domination, similar to its buildup in steel, aluminum, solar panels, electric vehicles and critical minerals.
“This is enabling its companies to rapidly expand capacity and to offer artificially lower priced chips that threaten to significantly harm and potentially eliminate their market-oriented competition,” she told reporters on a conference call.
Legacy chips use older, mature manufacturing processes and are found in a wide range of mass market applications. They do not include advanced chips for use in artificial intelligence applications or sophisticated microprocessors.
The Biden administration will begin accepting public comments on the probe on Jan. 6, and has planned a public hearing for March 11-12, according to a Federal Register notice on the probe. It is unclear whether Trump’s choice to lead USTR, Jamieson Greer, a trade lawyer and former USTR chief during Trump’s first administration, will be confirmed by the U.S. Senate by then.
The probe is being conducted under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the same unfair trade practices statute that Trump invoked to impose tariffs of up to 25% on some $370 billion worth of Chinese imports in 2018 and 2019, triggering a nearly three-year trade war with Beijing.
If Trump takes up the probe, it needs to be completed within a year from initiation.
DOWNSTREAM GOODS PROBED
A Biden administration official said in addition to examining the impact of the imported chips themselves, the probe would also look at their incorporation into downstream components and end-use goods for critical industries including defense, automotive products and medical devices.
It also will target China’s production of silicon carbide substrates and wafers for semiconductor fabrication.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said her department’s research shows two-thirds of U.S. products using chips had Chinese legacy chips in them, and half of U.S. companies did not know the origin of their chips including some in the defense industry, findings that were “fairly alarming.”
After the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the supply of semiconductors and temporarily halted production of autos and medical equipment, the U.S. has sought to build its own semiconductor supply chain with $52.7 billion in new subsidies for chip production, research and workforce development.
But Raimondo said China’s plans to build more than 60% of the world’s new legacy chip capacity over the next decade were discouraging investment elsewhere and constituted unfair competition.
It “undercuts our companies and makes the U.S. dependent on China for the chips that we use every day in so many things,” she told reporters.
Despite a bitter presidential campaign, one of the few areas of continuity between Biden’s and Trump’s administrations will be tariffs on China. Biden kept in place all of the duties on Chinese imports imposed by Trump and added to them, including 100% duties on Chinese-made electric vehicles in an effort to keep them out of the U.S. market.

Title: Gold gains 30% in 2024, silver up 35% on COMEX this year: MOFSL
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 10:45:03 +0000
Content: Gold and silver have experienced an impressive rally in 2024, gaining approximately 30% and 35%, respectively, on the Commodity Exchange (COMEX), a report revealed on Monday.
While central bank policies and geopolitical risks are significant drivers of gold and silver prices, other factors also play a role in shaping the market, according to the report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd (MOFSL).
In 2024, global demand for precious metals increased substantially. Central banks worldwide, including those in emerging markets, have been net buyers of gold for over a decade. In 2024, they collectively purchased more than 500 tonnes of gold, reflecting a strategy to diversify reserves amid economic uncertainties, the report stated.
“Looking ahead, the outlook for gold and silver remains positive, although some market consolidation or short-term dips may present buying opportunities. A loose monetary policy environment, coupled with ongoing geopolitical risks, should continue to provide a favourable backdrop for gold and silver,” said Manav Modi, Analyst, Commodity Research, MOFSL.
The growing interest from central banks has added upward pressure on prices, as these institutions accumulate gold as a hedge against the volatility of fiat currencies.
The recent resurgence in gold ETFs, which had seen outflows in previous years, indicates renewed investor interest in gold as a safe-haven asset.
“In India, domestic demand has surged, with assets under management in gold and silver ETFs surpassing Rs 30,000 crore and Rs 7,500 crore, respectively. Additionally, the reduction of import duties on gold and silver by the Indian government has spurred demand, especially during festive and wedding seasons, further driving up prices,” the report mentioned.
Overall imports for both gold and silver on the domestic front have been significant this year, totalling more than 700 tonnes and 6,000 tonnes, respectively.
“The role of central bank actions and geopolitical risks in driving gold and silver prices has been a key factor, considering the broader economic environment,” the report noted.
Central bank monetary policies are pivotal in shaping economic conditions, and recent developments from the Federal Reserve highlight this dynamic.
The US Fed’s announcement of a 50 bps rate cut indicates a proactive approach to stimulate the economy amid easing inflation and concerns regarding the labour market, the report stated.

Title: PM Modi condemns Germany market attack, advocates brotherhood at CBCI Christmas event
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 17:21:56 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday condemned attempts to incite violence in society, highlighting that the teachings of Jesus Christ promote love, harmony, and brotherhood.
While speaking at the Christmas event hosted by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India (CBCI) at its headquarters here, PM Modi stressed the need to work together to embody the values taught by Jesus and strengthen this spirit of unity.
He also condemned last week’s terror attack at Germany’s Magdeburg Christmas Market, where an SUV drove into a crowd, resulting in the deaths of four women and a nine-year-old child, while injuring 205 people. Among the injured were seven Indians.
PM Modi stressed the importance of prioritising human interests alongside national interests, stating that India’s foreign policy reflects this approach.
He highlighted India’s humanitarian efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic, where the country helped over 150 nations by providing medicines and vaccines. This approach, centred on human welfare, had a positive global impact, with countries like Guyana and several island nations expressing deep gratitude.
“India went beyond its capabilities to help other countries during the Covid-19 pandemic, providing medicines to over 150 nations,” he said.
He also highlighted the evacuation of Indians stranded in war-torn nations, saying that no matter where they are or what crisis they face, today’s India sees it as its duty to bring its citizens to safety.
“We brought back our nurses who got stuck in the Gulf countries. It was a very satisfactory moment for me when we safely brought Father Alexis Prem Kumar from war-torn Afghanistan, a decade back. He was stuck there for 8 months and was in hostage… for us, all these missions are not mere diplomatic missions but an emotional commitment to bring back family members,” he said.
The Prime Minister further expressed pride in George Koovakad’s elevation as a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Catholic Church.
“It is a moment of pride that His Holiness Pope Francis has made His Eminence George Koovakad a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Catholic Church,” he said.
He stressed the significance of hope in transforming the world, drawing attention to India’s achievements over the past decade.
PM Modi pointed out that 250 million people have overcome poverty, and the nation’s economy has grown from the 10th to the 5th largest globally.
He praised the country’s youth for their drive and ambition, and highlighted the empowerment of women across sectors, including entrepreneurship and the armed forces, emphasising that no nation can progress without empowering women.
PM Modi also discussed India’s strides in technology, with advancements in mobile and semiconductor manufacturing. He underlined the importance of technology in empowering the poor and the rapid infrastructure development taking place, including new expressways, rural roads, and metro routes.
These initiatives, he said, inspire hope for a brighter future for India.
The Prime Minister reiterated the values of compassion and selfless service taught by Jesus Christ, stressing the role of institutions in serving society. He commended the government’s initiatives, such as the PM Awas Yojana, which empowers women by building homes in their names, and the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam, which has increased women’s participation in Parliament.
PM Modi concluded by reiterating the importance of collective effort in building a developed India.
He expressed his confidence that, with ongoing initiatives like Swachh Bharat and support for local artisans, India will continue to progress.
“A developed India is our shared goal, and together, we will achieve it,” he affirmed, wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and a hopeful Jubilee Year.

Title: NIA arrests key aide of designated Khalistani terrorist Lakhbir Singh Landa
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 16:25:10 +0000
Content: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has arrested Jatinder Singh, alias Jyoti, a key aide of designated Khalistani terrorist Lakhbir Singh Landa and gangster Bachitar Singh, also known as Pavitar Batala. The arrest marks a critical breakthrough in the Punjab terror conspiracy case.
Jatinder, a resident of Gurdaspur in Punjab, was apprehended in Mumbai following extensive on-ground and technical operations by the NIA. He had been on the run since July 2024, evading arrest after the agency captured weapons supplier Baljit Singh, alias Rana Bhai, a resident of Madhya Pradesh.
According to the NIA, Jatinder is a member of a terror gang led by Landa, who operates from abroad as part of the banned Babbar Khalsa International (BKI), and is closely linked to Batala, Landa’s associate. The investigations revealed Jatinder’s active involvement in the smuggling of arms and their delivery to on-ground operatives in Punjab.
The agency stated that Jatinder had procured ten pistols from Baljit Singh in Madhya Pradesh and transported them to Punjab to aid Landa and Batala’s network. He had also been planning to bring additional weapons from Madhya Pradesh, but the NIA’s sustained surveillance thwarted his attempts.
The NIA’s efforts have been part of a broader operation to dismantle the nexus between terror networks and gangsters. Jatinder’s arrest is seen as a step towards preventing the smuggling of weapons, ammunition, and explosives that fuel terrorist activities in India.

Title: Veteran Filmmaker Shyam Benegal passes away at 90
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 15:54:03 +0000
Content: Renowned filmmaker Shyam Benegal, a trailblazer of India’s parallel cinema movement, passed away on Monday in Mumbai at the age of 90. The legendary director had been battling a prolonged kidney ailment and was receiving treatment at Wockhardt Hospital.
His funeral is scheduled for 10:00 am on Tuesday in Mumbai.
Widely regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers of post-1970s India, Benegal’s contributions to cinema earned him numerous accolades, including 18 National Film Awards, a Nandi Award, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, Padma Shri, and Padma Bhushan. Just a few months ago, the director had celebrated his milestone 90th birthday in Mumbai.
Born in Hyderabad to Sridhar B. Benegal, a noted figure in photography, Shyam Benegal was a second cousin to celebrated filmmaker Guru Dutt. He began his creative journey as a copywriter and made his first documentary film, Gher Betha Ganga (1962), in Gujarati.
His early feature films—Ankur (1973), Nishant (1975), Manthan (1976), and Bhumika (1977)—firmly established him as a pioneer of the New Wave cinema movement in India.
From 1980 to 1986, Benegal served as the Director of the National Film Development Corporation (NFDC), where he contributed significantly to the growth of independent Indian cinema.
Benegal’s diverse storytelling style and ability to explore complex themes won him widespread acclaim. His 1983 film Mandi, a satirical take on politics and prostitution featuring Shabana Azmi and Smita Patil, remains a classic. With Trikal, based on the waning days of Portuguese rule in Goa, he delved deep into the intricacies of human relationships.
In the 1980s, amid a challenging phase for parallel cinema marked by declining funding due to the advent of VCRs, Benegal adapted to the changing landscape of Indian entertainment. He turned to television, creating the iconic series Bharat Ek Khoj, which chronicled the history of India and became a cultural milestone.

Title: Coffee and Tea may reduce risk of head and neck cancer, study finds
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 14:36:49 +0000
Content: Regular consumption of coffee and tea may help lower the risk of developing head and neck cancers, including cancers of the mouth and throat, according to a study published on Monday in the CANCER journal. These findings could hold significant implications for the global fight against one of the most prevalent forms of cancer.
Head and neck cancer is the seventh most common type of cancer worldwide, with rising rates, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The study analyzed data from 14 previous studies and included information on 9,548 patients with head and neck cancers, compared with 15,783 individuals without cancer.
The research revealed that individuals who consumed more than four cups of caffeinated coffee daily had 17% lower odds of developing head and neck cancers overall compared to non-coffee drinkers. Notably, they had a 30% lower risk of oral cavity cancer and a 22% lower risk of throat cancer.
Furthermore, consuming three to four cups of caffeinated coffee was associated with a striking 41% lower risk of hypopharyngeal cancer—a type of cancer that affects the bottom of the throat. The study also observed some protective effects of decaffeinated coffee, with a 25% lower likelihood of oral cavity cancer among those who drank it.
Tea consumption showed similar benefits but with nuances. Drinking tea was linked to a 29% reduction in the odds of developing hypopharyngeal cancer. However, while drinking one cup or less daily reduced the overall risk of head and neck cancers by 9% and hypopharyngeal cancer by 27%, consuming more than one cup daily was associated with a 38% higher likelihood of developing laryngeal cancer.
“These findings demonstrate the varying effects of coffee and tea on different sub-sites of head and neck cancer, even suggesting some benefits from decaffeinated coffee,” said senior author Yuan-Chin Amy Lee from Huntsman Cancer Institute and the University of Utah School of Medicine. Lee underscored the complexity of coffee and tea consumption habits and emphasized the need for further research to better understand their role in cancer prevention.
Participants in the study completed detailed questionnaires about their consumption of caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, and tea over varying time frames. The researchers concluded that while coffee and tea show promise in reducing cancer risks, additional studies are needed to fully explore and confirm their protective effects.
This study offers a hopeful perspective on the potential health benefits of coffee and tea, particularly in mitigating the risks associated with certain types of cancer. However, moderation and further investigation remain key to understanding their long-term impacts.

Title: EAM Jaishankar to visit US ahead of Trump’s second term
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 13:42:04 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar will embark on an official visit to the United States from December 24 to 29, according to a statement from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).
The visit comes as preparations are underway for US President-elect Donald Trump to assume office for his second term on January 20. Jaishankar’s agenda includes discussions with key counterparts on bilateral, regional, and global issues. The EAM will also chair a conference with India’s Consul Generals in the USA during his stay.
This diplomatic engagement follows a congratulatory phone call last month between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Donald Trump, during which Modi expressed eagerness to work together once again.
“Had a great conversation with my friend, President Donald Trump, congratulating him on his spectacular victory. Looking forward to working closely together to strengthen India-US relations across technology, defense, energy, space, and other sectors,” Modi wrote on X.
Trump, in turn, reportedly conveyed admiration for Modi, referring to him as a “magnificent man” and describing India as a “magnificent country.” Both leaders reiterated their shared commitment to fostering global peace and furthering the partnership between their nations.
As Modi rekindles diplomatic ties with Trump, it’s noteworthy that India-US relations also flourished during President Joe Biden’s tenure. The two leaders built strong rapport, engaging in multiple personal meetings over the past four years.
Most recently, they convened during the G20 Summit in Brazil and at Biden’s weekend retreat in Delaware. Last year, Biden made a historic visit to India for the G20 summit hosted by Modi, marking another milestone in their collaboration. Modi was also received in Washington during a state visit marked by ceremonial grandeur.
Biden said, “Each time, I was struck by our ability to find new areas of cooperation. Together, we’re unlocking a shared future of unlimited potential.”
Under Biden’s leadership, the India-US partnership expanded significantly. The two nations elevated the Quad—a strategic alliance involving Japan and Australia—to the summit level. Additionally, the I2U2 grouping comprising India, Israel, the UAE, and the US was established to promote cooperation across India’s western flank, mirroring the Quad’s objectives in the Indo-Pacific region.

Title: Nearly 10 Lakh jobs distributed under Rozgar Mela since 2022: PM Modi
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 13:15:31 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Monday that nearly 10 lakh permanent government jobs have been offered through the Rozgar Mela initiative since its inception in October 2022.
Speaking at the 14th edition of the recruitment drive, PM Modi described it as a milestone in the government’s efforts to provide transparent and fair employment opportunities.
Launched on October 22, 2022, Rozgar Mela aims to recruit 10 lakh personnel across various government ministries and departments. In its inaugural edition, appointment letters were handed over to 75,000 new recruits. Since then, the initiative has conducted 14 editions, distributing 9.25 lakh job letters.
On Monday, 71,000 new appointees received their appointment letters during ceremonies held at 45 locations across the country. The latest drive reflects the government’s commitment to creating job opportunities and addressing unemployment.
The Rozgar Mela has emerged as a platform for connecting job seekers with employers, empowering individuals to contribute to India’s development. PM Modi underscored the government’s efforts to facilitate employment and ensure transparency in the recruitment process.
In the 13th edition held on October 29, 51,000 appointment letters were distributed. On the occasion, the Prime Minister emphasized initiatives to enhance international employment prospects for Indian youth. He cited Germany’s Skilled Labour Strategy, which increased annual visas for skilled Indian workers from 20,000 to 90,000. Additionally, India has signed migration and employment agreements with 21 countries, including Japan, Australia, France, Germany, and Gulf nations.
A total of 71,000 appointees each were given letters in Rozgar Mela edition number 2, 3, 4 and 5. In the sixth (June 13) and seventh editions (July 22), 70,000 appointment letters each were distributed by the PM.

Content: Researchers in Siberia are conducting tests on a juvenile mammoth whose remarkably well-preserved remains were discovered in thawing permafrost after more than 50,000 years.
The creature, resembling a small elephant with a trunk, was recovered from the Batagaika crater, a huge depression more than 80 metres (260 feet) deep which is widening as a result of climate change.
The carcass, weighing more than 110 kg (240 pounds), was brought to the surface on an improvised stretcher, said Maxim Cherpasov, head of the Lazarev Mammoth Museum Laboratory in the city of Yakutsk.
He said the mammoth was probably a little over a year old when it died, but tests would enable the scientists to confirm this more accurately. The fact that its head and trunk had survived was particularly unusual.
“As a rule, the part that thaws out first, especially the trunk, is often eaten by modern predators or birds. Here, for example, even though the forelimbs have already been eaten, the head is remarkably well preserved,” Cherpasov told Reuters.
It is the latest of a series of spectacular discoveries in the Russian permafrost. Last month, scientists in the same vast northeastern region – known as Sakha or Yakutia – showed off the 32,000-year-old remains of a tiny sabre-toothed cat cub, while earlier this year a 44,000-year-old wolf carcass was uncovered.

Title: Bangladesh requests India to return ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:47:38 +0000
Content: Bangladesh has formally requested India to send back former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India following her ousting on August 5 after a student-led movement.
The request was made through a “note verbale” to the Indian government, according to Touhid Hossain, the Foreign Affairs Adviser of Bangladesh’s Interim government, as reported by local media outlets. Hossain confirmed the submission of the note verbale, seeking the return of the 76-year-old leader.
Hasina, who had been in power for over a decade, was removed from office after weeks of student-led protests and violent clashes that resulted in over 600 deaths. In the wake of her ouster, she fled to India, and a new interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus was established in Bangladesh.
In a recent statement made on December 9, Hasina accused Yunus, the Chief Adviser to the interim government, of orchestrating the student protests that led to her removal. She described the protests as a “meticulously designed” effort to topple her administration.
Speaking at a virtual meeting of the United Kingdom Awami League, Hasina claimed that despite the demands of the protesters being met, unrest continued, implying a deeper conspiracy to remove her from power.
Hasina specifically pointed to Yunus, accusing him of being the “mastermind” behind the protests that started on July 7, 2024. She argued that the protests, which she claims were not student-initiated, were part of a well-planned strategy to remove her from office, even after her government addressed the protesters’ demands.
The ousted leader also voiced criticism against the interim government’s actions, describing it as “fascist” and accusing it of depriving the people of Bangladesh of their fundamental rights. She said, “Today, Bangladesh is going through a tough time. Under a fascist government, the people of Bangladesh have been deprived of their rights. The whole of Bangladesh is burning… Today, Bangladesh is being destroyed.”
Hasina also referenced the arrest of former ISKCON priest Chinmoy Krishna Das, who was detained on alleged sedition charges. She criticized the government for preventing Das from having legal representation, calling it a glaring example of the country’s deteriorating justice system.
“They arrested Chinmoy Krishna Das and said there couldn’t be any kind of lawyer defending him. What kind of justice is this?…This proves that Bangladesh doesn’t have law and order,” she added.

Title: Some gaps have narrowed in elusive Gaza ceasefire deal, sides say
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:34:02 +0000
Content: Gaps between Israel and Hamas over a possible Gaza ceasefire have narrowed, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials’ remarks on Monday, though crucial differences have yet to be resolved.
A fresh bid by mediators Egypt, Qatar and the United States to end the fighting and release Israeli and foreign hostages has gained momentum this month, though no breakthrough has yet been reported.
A Palestinian official familiar with the talks said while some sticking points had been resolved, the identity of some of the Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel in return for hostages had yet to be agreed, along with the precise deployment of Israeli troops in Gaza.
His remarks corresponded with comments by the Israeli diaspora minister, Amichai Chikli, who said both issues were still being negotiated. Nonetheless, he said, the sides were far closer to reaching agreement than they have been for months.
“This ceasefire can last six months or it can last 10 years, it depends on the dynamics that will form on the ground,” Chikli told Israel’s Kan radio. 
Much hinged on what powers would be running and rehabilitating Gaza once fighting stopped, he said.
The duration of the ceasefire has been a fundamental sticking point throughout several rounds of failed negotiations. Hamas wants an end to the war, while Israel wants an end to Hamas’ rule of Gaza first.
“The issue of ending the war completely hasn’t yet been resolved,” said the Palestinian official.
Israeli minister Zeev Elkin, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet, told Israel’s Army Radio that the aim was to find an agreed framework that would resolve that difference during a second stage of the ceasefire deal.
Chikli said the first stage would be a humanitarian phase that will last 42 days and include a hostage release.
Hospital

The war was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.
Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza has since killed more than 45,200 Palestinians, according to health officials in the Hamas-run enclave. 
Most of the population of 2.3 million has been displaced and much of Gaza is in ruins. At least 11 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes on Monday, medics said.
One of Gaza’s few still partially functioning hospitals, on its northern edge, an area under intense Israeli military pressure for nearly three months, sought urgent help after being hit by Israeli fire.
“We are facing a continuous daily threat,” said Hussam Abu Safiya, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital. 
“The bombing continues from all directions, affecting the building, the departments, and the staff.”
The Israeli military did not immediately comment. On Sunday it said it was supplying fuel and food to the hospital and helping evacuate some patients and staff to safer areas.
Palestinians accuse Israel of seeking to permanently depopulate northern Gaza to create a buffer zone, which Israel denies.
Israel says its operation around the three communities on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip – Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia – is targeting Hamas militants.
On Monday, the United Nations’ aid chief, Tom Fletcher, said Israeli forces had hampered efforts to deliver much needed aid in northern Gaza.
“North Gaza has been under a near-total siege for more than two months, raising the spectre of famine,” he said. 
“South Gaza is extremely overcrowded, creating horrific living conditions and even greater humanitarian needs as winter sets in.”

Title: Stock market gains nearly 500 points amid positive global cues
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:23:35 +0000
Content: After a week of losses, Indian equity markets closed on a positive note on Monday, buoyed by strong global cues. The domestic benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty, rebounded after witnessing a near 5% decline over the past five consecutive trading sessions.
Realty and PSU bank stocks led the rally in the Nifty, driving the market upwards.
At the close, the Sensex settled at 78,540.17, marking a gain of 498.58 points or 0.64%, while the Nifty ended at 23,753.45, up 165.95 points or 0.70%.
The Nifty Bank index climbed 558.40 points, or 1.10%, to close at 51,317.60. The Nifty Midcap 100 index rose by 186.15 points or 0.33%, ending at 57,092.90. However, the Nifty Smallcap 100 index declined slightly, losing 26.50 points or 0.14% to close at 18,687.80.
V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, pointed out that short-term market recoveries may continue but could face renewed pressure from Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) selling.
“In the short run, there will be market rebounds, which may be followed by renewed FII selling. A sustained rally is possible only when we see clear signs of economic growth revival, likely in early 2025,” he said.
Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, attributed the optimism to improved global data and positive sentiment in interest rate-sensitive sectors.
“The lower-than-expected US PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) data boosted investor confidence, particularly in metals, which benefited from expectations of higher steel import taxes. However, the short-term outlook remains sideways due to a lack of fresh catalysts and the impact of the festive season,” he said.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), 1,640 shares advanced, while 2,445 declined, and 133 remained unchanged.
Sectorally, most indices ended in green, with realty and PSU banks gaining the most. However, Auto, Media, and Healthcare sectors recorded minor losses.
In the Sensex pack, top gainers included ITC, Tech Mahindra, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, Titan, SBI, ICICI Bank, Adani Ports, Tata Steel, and Bharti Airtel. On the other hand, Zomato, Maruti, Nestle India, HCL Tech, and Bajaj Finserv were among the top losers.
Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) sold equities worth ₹3,597.82 crore on December 20, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) purchased equities worth ₹1,374.37 crore on the same day.
Earlier in the session, the Indian stock market jumped over 600 points amid mixed but largely positive global cues, signaling renewed optimism among investors.

Title: JPC to meet on Dec 26-27 to record oral evidence from state representatives on Waqf Bill
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 06:41:04 +0000
Content: The Joint Committee on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill will convene on December 26 and 27 to record oral evidence from state representatives as part of its ongoing deliberations on the proposed legislation.
During these sessions, the Committee will hear from representatives of Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan on December 26, followed by Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, and Delhi on December 27.
On Thursday, the JPC met with Muslim representatives from Lucknow and Rajasthan. After the meeting, Jagdambika Pal, Chairman of the Joint Committee, said, “The former Vice Chancellor of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Language University, Lucknow, and the former Chairman of the Rajasthan Waqf Board presented their proposed amendments. There was a clause-by-clause discussion, with MPs also posing questions.”
Among the attendees were Syed Abubakar Naqvi, the former Chairman and State Minister of the Rajasthan Waqf Board, and Prof. Mahrukh Mirza, the former Vice Chancellor of Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti Language University, Lucknow.
Earlier, on Wednesday, the JPC engaged with members of the All India Shia Personal Law Board to hear their views on the Bill.
Recently, the Lok Sabha approved a motion to extend the JPC’s tenure on the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, mandating the presentation of their report by the end of the 2025 Budget Session.
On December 5, Jagdambika Pal noted that the Committee had held 27 meetings in Delhi before the extension of its tenure. These meetings involved discussions with various stakeholders and government ministries.
The Waqf Act of 1995, which governs Waqf properties, has faced long-standing criticisms for issues such as mismanagement, corruption, and encroachments. The Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024, seeks to address these concerns by introducing reforms such as digitisation, enhanced audits, improved transparency, and legal mechanisms to reclaim illegally occupied properties.
The JPC is conducting extensive consultations with government officials, legal experts, Waqf Board members, and community representatives from various states and Union Territories to ensure a comprehensive overhaul of the legislation.

Title: Amit Shah to inaugurate 10,000 new PACS, dairy and fisheries cooperative societies to strengthen rural economy
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 06:25:38 +0000
Content: Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah will inaugurate 10,000 newly established multipurpose Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), along with dairy and fisheries cooperative societies, on Wednesday.
This milestone event comes nearly nine months after Shah unveiled the National Cooperative Database in March, a transformative initiative designed to compile essential data on India’s vast cooperative sector. At the launch, Shah emphasized that the database, spearheaded by the Ministry of Cooperation to realize Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of “Sahakar se Samriddhi would serve as a catalyst for advancing the cooperative movement. The ministry underscored the critical need for a comprehensive database to efficiently document and analyze information about cooperatives across the country.
The launch of the National Cooperative Database (NCD) marked a significant milestone for the cooperative sector. The growth of cooperatives in rural areas holds the potential to address economic, social, and community challenges, empower individuals, reduce poverty, and contribute to the overall well-being of rural communities.
The database’s development involved phased data collection from various stakeholders. In the first phase, approximately 2.64 lakh primary cooperative societies in three sectors—Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), Dairy, and Fisheries—were mapped.
In the second phase, data from National Federations, State Federations, State Cooperative Banks (StCB), District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCBs), Urban Cooperative Banks (UCBs), State Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks (SCARDB), Primary Cooperative Agriculture and Rural Development Banks (PCARDB), Sugar Cooperative Mills, District Unions, and Multi-State Cooperative Societies (MSCS) were collected and mapped.
In the third phase, data from over 5.3 lakh primary cooperative societies across remaining sectors were mapped through state and UT RCS and DRCS offices.
The National Cooperative Database is a web-based digital dashboard that records data on cooperative societies, including national and state federations. State and UT nodal officials at RCS and DRCS offices validated the data of cooperative societies, while federations provided their data directly.
The database has successfully collected and mapped information on around eight lakh cooperatives, representing a collective membership of more than 29 crore people across various sectors. It includes parameters such as the registered name, registration date, location, membership size, sectoral details, operational areas, economic activities, financial statements, and audit status of cooperatives.
This comprehensive database serves as a crucial tool for efficient communication between the central ministry, states, UTs, and cooperative societies, benefiting all stakeholders. It provides detailed contact information for registered societies, streamlining communication between government bodies and cooperatives.
The National Cooperative Database offers numerous advantages, such as single-point access to comprehensive and updated data, a user-friendly interface, vertical and horizontal linkages, query-based reports and graphs, Management Information System (MIS) reports, data analytics, and geographical mapping.
The success of this initiative hinges on effective collaboration, accurate data collection, and strategic use of the database to identify sectoral gaps and make informed decisions to address them. Ultimately, the database promotes transparency and collaboration within the cooperative sector.

Title: Prime Minister Modi urges unity to uphold harmony and confront challenges
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 05:39:25 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged people to unite to uphold harmony and confront challenges like violence and disruptions in society.
He made these remarks during the Christmas event hosted by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India (CBCI) at its headquarters on Monday, with clips of the speech later posted on his X handle on Tuesday.
The Prime Minister said the teachings of Jesus Christ celebrate love, harmony, and brotherhood. “We must unite to uphold harmony and confront challenges like violence and disruptions in society,” he said.
“When the COVID-19 pandemic struck, India went beyond its own capabilities to help numerous countries. We provided medicines to several countries across the world and sent vaccines to many nations,” the PM said.
PM Modi said that over the past decade, India has made transformative progress in poverty alleviation and economic growth. “We are now empowering both youth (Yuva) and women (Nari Shakti), paving the way for a brighter and more confident future,” he said.
He emphasized that by prioritizing social welfare and empowerment, India has implemented transformative policies in various sectors. “Our initiatives, such as the PM Awas Yojana and Matsya Sampada Yojana, have significantly improved the lives of countless people.”
PM Modi stressed the importance of working together to embody the values taught by Jesus and reinforce the spirit of unity. He also condemned last week’s terror attack at Germany’s Magdeburg Christmas Market, where an SUV drove into a crowd, resulting in the deaths of four women and a nine-year-old child, while injuring 205 people. Among the injured were seven Indians.
The Prime Minister stressed the importance of prioritizing human interests alongside national interests, saying that India’s foreign policy reflects this approach.
He highlighted India’s humanitarian efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic, during which the country helped over 150 nations by providing medicines and vaccines. This approach centered on human welfare had a positive global impact, with countries like Guyana and several island nations expressing deep gratitude.
He also highlighted the evacuation of Indians stranded in war-torn nations, saying that no matter where they are or what crisis they face, today’s India sees it as its duty to bring its citizens to safety. “We brought back our nurses who got stuck in the Gulf countries. It was a very satisfactory moment for me when we safely brought Father Alexis Prem Kumar from war-torn Afghanistan, a decade back. He was stuck there for 8 months and was in hostage… for us, all these missions are not mere diplomatic missions but an emotional commitment to bring back family members,” he said.
The Prime Minister further expressed pride in George Koovakad’s elevation as a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Catholic Church. “It is a moment of pride that His Holiness Pope Francis has made His Eminence George Koovakad a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Catholic Church,” he said.
He stressed the significance of hope in transforming the world, drawing attention to India’s achievements over the past decade.
PM Modi pointed out that 250 million people have overcome poverty, and the nation’s economy has grown from the 10th to the 5th largest globally.
He praised the country’s youth for their drive and ambition, and highlighted the empowerment of women across sectors, including entrepreneurship and the armed forces, emphasizing that no nation can progress without empowering women.
PM Modi also discussed India’s strides in technology, with advancements in mobile and semiconductor manufacturing. He underlined the importance of technology in empowering the poor and the rapid infrastructure development taking place, including new expressways, rural roads, and metro routes. These initiatives, he said, inspire hope for a brighter future for India.
The Prime Minister reiterated the values of compassion and selfless service taught by Jesus Christ, stressing the role of institutions in serving society. He commended the government’s initiatives, such as the PM Awas Yojana, which empowers women by building homes in their names, and the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam, which has increased women’s participation in Parliament.
PM Modi concluded by reiterating the importance of collective effort in building a developed India. He expressed his confidence that with ongoing initiatives like Swachh Bharat and support for local artisans, India will continue to progress. “A developed India is our shared goal, and together, we will achieve it,” he affirmed, wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and a hopeful Jubilee Year.

Title: India skipper Rohit backs Kohli to find fix for off-stump woes
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 05:21:39 +0000
Content: India captain Rohit Sharma has backed Virat Kohli to overcome his problems with deliveries outside the off-stump in Australia, saying on Tuesday that players of his calibre always find a way to succeed.
Kohli arrested a long run of poor form with an unbeaten century in the first test in Perth but has frequently chased balls moving away from his stumps in the current five-match series, resulting in his dismissal.
“Modern-day greats will figure out their own ways (to deal with the issue),” Rohit told reporters ahead of the Boxing Day test in Melbourne.
Rohit’s own batting frailties in the longest format have been laid bare in recent matches. The captain has managed scores of three, six and 10 since rejoining the team for the second test following the birth of his son.
His move to the middle order has done little to inspire confidence but Rohit was tight-lipped about a potential switch back to the opening slot where he can be devastating.
“Let’s not worry about that. I think ‘who bats where?’ is something that we need to figure out within ourselves. It’s not a thing I should be discussing in every press conference.
“Whatever it takes for our team to look good or gives us the best chance to succeed, we’ll try and do that.”
After winning the first test by 295 runs, India crashed to a 10-wicket defeat in Adelaide before battling to a draw in the rain-hit third match in Brisbane.
“At 1-1, I think it’s a fair reflection,” Rohit added.
“Both teams have played solid cricket and these two tests are going to be so important for both teams.
“We want to break it down to Melbourne and focus on what we can achieve here, get things right and play well.”
India added uncapped Mumbai all-rounder Tanush Kotian to the squad for the final two tests after ruling out the inclusion of seamer Mohammed Shami due to a knee injury.

Title: Who is Tanush Kotian, India’s uncapped call-up for the Australia Tests?
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 05:18:18 +0000
Content: Going into the second half of the Border-Gavaskar Series against Australia, India has made a solitary change to their squad for the final two Tests, giving all-rounder Tanush Kotian his maiden call-up to the Test side. Kotian replaces spin legend Ravichandran Ashwin, who announced his retirement from international cricket following the Brisbane Test.
The right-arm off-spinner joins India’s red-ball setup as a spin-bowling all-rounder who has recently proven his capabilities with the bat. Rising through the ranks in age-group cricket in Mumbai, Kotian was part of India’s Under-19 team in 2017 and competed in the U19 Asia Cup squad that year, alongside players like Riyan Parag and Arshdeep Singh. However, low returns in the lead-up to the tournament meant he missed out on selection for India’s squad for the 2018 ICC Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand, where the Prithvi Shaw-led side ultimately clinched the trophy.
Kotian’s performances in India’s age-group domestic tournaments, including the Vinoo Mankad Trophy, soon earned him a place in Mumbai’s senior team, according to ICC. He made his first-class debut for Mumbai in 2018 at the age of 20, taking two wickets against Saurashtra in the first innings. Since then, he has accumulated 101 first-class wickets at an average of 25.70 from 33 matches. A key player in Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy squad, Kotian has also impressed with the bat, scoring 1,525 runs, including two centuries and 13 half-centuries, at an average of 41.21.
During Mumbai’s triumphant Ranji Trophy campaign, Kotian was named Player of the Tournament after finishing with 29 wickets and scoring 502 runs at an average of 41.83, including a century and five fifties in 14 innings. In the ongoing red-ball season in India, the 26-year-old has claimed 12 wickets in five matches. He was signed by the Rajasthan Royals for IPL 2024 as a replacement for Adam Zampa, making his league debut but not getting the opportunity to bowl.
In October, Kotian smashed a century against the Rest of India side in the Irani Cup, a performance that earned him a spot in the India A squad for their tour of Australia ahead of the senior team’s five-Test series. He played in the second tour game in Melbourne, where he was dismissed for a duck in the first innings but contributed 44 runs and took one wicket in the second.
With the Test series shifting to Melbourne and Sydney—venues where spinners traditionally thrive—Kotian provides India with a valuable option alongside veterans Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar.
India’s squad for the fourth and fifth Tests: Rohit Sharma (C), Jasprit Bumrah (VC), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant (WK), Sarfaraz Khan, Dhruv Jurel (WK), Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammad Siraj, Akash Deep, Prasidh Krishna, Harshit Rana, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Washington Sundar, Devdutt Padikkal, Tanush Kotian.

Title: North India grapples with freezing temperatures
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 05:00:16 +0000
Content: A biting cold wave has gripped North India, with temperatures plunging across multiple states, disrupting daily life. Delhi witnessed a minimum temperature of 7 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, as a thin fog blanketed parts of the city. The previous day, the capital recorded a minimum of 8 degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperature reached 20 degrees Celsius.
Residents of Delhi braved the chill by gathering around bonfires, while others sought refuge in night shelters as the mercury continued to dip.
In Rajasthan, the cold weather has similarly disrupted routine life. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) reported a temperature of 9 degrees Celsius in Bikaner, reflecting the persistent cold conditions in the region.
Jammu and Kashmir remains among the most affected areas, with sub-zero temperatures recorded in several parts. Srinagar registered -5.2 degrees Celsius early Tuesday morning, while other regions like Gulmarg, Pahalgam, Banihal, and Kupwara recorded temperatures of -0.6, -6.8, -0.8, and -4.6 degrees Celsius, respectively. On Monday, Srinagar’s minimum temperature dipped to -7 degrees Celsius, with the maximum reaching just 7 degrees Celsius.
The IMD defines a cold wave as occurring when the minimum temperature in plains drops to 10 degrees Celsius or less, and in hilly regions to 0 degrees Celsius or below. A severe cold wave has been forecast for Jammu and Kashmir starting December 24, while Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and other northern states are expected to experience dense fog and cold wave conditions between December 23 and 25.
Adding to the region’s woes, Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) entered the ‘severe’ category on Tuesday, with fog further limiting visibility. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recorded the AQI at 401 at 8 AM, slightly better than Monday’s 403 at 7 AM. Specific AQI readings included alarming levels of 417 in Alipur, 423 in Anand Vihar, 425 in RK Puram, and 402 at ITO.
According to CPCB parameters, AQI levels range from ‘good’ (0-50) to ‘severe’ (401-500), with anything above 400 indicating hazardous air quality.

Title: France: President Emmanuel Macron unveils new government
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 04:57:54 +0000
Content: French President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a new government on Monday following the collapse of the previous Cabinet. According to a report by ‘The New York Times’, the center-right orientation of the new French government closely resembles that of its predecessor, which lasted less than three months due to criticism from both the left and far right in Parliament.
The newly appointed Prime Minister, François Bayrou, has formed the country’s fourth government, and the full list of ministers was announced on Monday.

Title: Ayush 2024: A Landmark Year for Global Traditional Medicine and Wellness
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 04:34:49 +0000
Content: 2024 has been a milestone year for the Ministry of Ayush, marking significant strides in the global promotion and recognition of traditional medicine.
From integrating Ayurveda, Yoga, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy into mainstream healthcare systems worldwide to forging key agreements with international organizations, Ayush has strengthened India’s leadership in wellness.
A major highlight of the year was the inclusion of traditional medicine in the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) by the World Health Organization (WHO).
This effort, which encompasses terminology and data from Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani Medicine, has enhanced the scope for Ayush-based research, policy-making, and healthcare delivery, positioning India at the forefront of holistic health practices.
The year began with a successful Surya Namaskar program from January 1 to 14, drawing nationwide participation to raise awareness of yoga’s benefits. Gujarat set a Guinness World Record for Surya Namaskar, leading to similar programs being organized at 19 major Sun Temples across the country.
Ayush’s presence at the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit and National Arogya Fairs in Mumbai and Delhi showcased India’s traditional medicine’s potential to contribute to global health trends.
At the Bharat Parv 2024, Ayush activities, including yoga demonstrations and free OPDs, attracted substantial attention.
In a significant development, Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the Central Research Institute of Yoga & Naturopathy (CRIYN) in Jhajjar, Haryana, reflecting the government’s dedication to advancing yoga and naturopathy.
The inauguration of the Ayush Holistic Wellness Centre at the Supreme Court of India was another landmark, aiming to bring traditional wellness practices into mainstream institutions.
Collaborations between the Ministry of Ayush and international organizations also flourished.
An MoU with the Ministry of Women and Child Development was signed to improve adolescent nutrition through Ayurveda interventions.
Additionally, partnerships with countries like Zimbabwe, Vietnam, and Malaysia boosted the global footprint of Indian traditional medicine.
On Unani Day 2024, medicines and e-books were released, furthering Unani’s reach. The Ministry also signed an MoU with the Research and Information System for Developing Countries (RIS) to enhance Ayush service sectors.
Ayush’s global diplomacy was highlighted by the WHO Global Traditional Medicine Centre agreement in Jamnagar, Gujarat. This 10-year, $85 million collaboration with WHO strengthens India’s role as a global leader in traditional medicine.
International Day of Yoga 2024 saw record participation with over 24.53 crore people involved, further promoting the importance of yoga for personal and societal well-being.
The Ministry’s achievements in 2024 culminated in its participation in World Food India, where the Ayush Pavilion demonstrated the significant role of Ayurveda in modern nutrition.
 The year’s events reflect the Ministry of Ayush’s ongoing commitment to promoting holistic health, advancing research, and fostering global cooperation in traditional medicine.

Title: Medical professionals have responsibility to improve, protect people’s health and lives: President Murmu
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 04:25:24 +0000
Content: President Droupadi Murmu emphasised the vital role of medical professionals in safeguarding people’s health and well-being, describing the medical profession as more than just a career—it is a noble duty to alleviate suffering and enhance the quality of life.
Speaking at the convocation ceremony of Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi, President Murmu highlighted the ethical and compassionate dimensions of the profession. She urged medical practitioners to see their patients not merely as cases, but as human beings grappling with fear and hope, deserving not just medical care but also encouragement and empathy.
“The medical profession carries the sacred responsibility of easing pain, treating illness, and fostering societal well-being,” she said, emphasizing the dual role of doctors as healers and compassionate caregivers.
President Murmu also pointed to the transformative role of technology in healthcare, advocating for greater collaboration between medical and engineering institutions. Innovations in Artificial Intelligence, mRNA technology, robotics, and 3D bioprinting, she noted, are poised to revolutionize medicine. She encouraged Vardhman Mahavir Medical College and Safdarjung Hospital to engage with Delhi’s engineering and technology institutes to drive research and innovation through interdisciplinary collaboration.
Acknowledging the government’s strides toward building a ‘Healthy India,’ President Murmu stressed the importance of skilled and dedicated doctors in maximizing the benefits of health infrastructure. She highlighted the government’s vision of making India a developed nation by 2047 and called on young doctors to lead the charge in elevating India’s global standing in healthcare through education, research, and entrepreneurship.

Title: Quantum tech, ANRF, women scientists rule Indian science sector in 2024: Centre
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 12:47:50 +0000
Content: Quantum technology, the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), and women scientists were key highlights of the Indian science sector in 2024, according to the Union government.
India’s global rankings in science and technology saw improvement. The country moved to 39th position on the Global Innovation Index (GII) 2024, reflecting advancements in innovation. Additionally, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Report 2023 placed India in the sixth position for intellectual property filings. The Network Readiness Index (NRI) 2024 reported that India climbed to 49th position, compared to its 79th ranking in 2019.
The ANRF Act, 2023, implemented from February 5, was aimed at enhancing research and innovation capabilities. Under ANRF initiatives in 2024, programmes such as the Prime Minister’s Early Career Research Grant, the EV Mission, and the Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR) were introduced. A scheme for Inclusivity Research Grant (IRG) was also launched.
The National Quantum Mission (NQM) received approval from the Union Cabinet with a total outlay of ₹6,003.65 crore over eight years. The mission seeks to develop scientific and industrial R&D and foster an ecosystem for quantum technology.
Geospatial technology initiatives progressed in 2024, with enhancements in data and infrastructure improving public services. The Geospatial Capacity Building programme initiated a spatial thinking initiative in schools, covering seven states, 49 districts, and 16 schools. The programme engaged 154 teachers and reached over 6,200 students.

Title: Global hunger crisis deepens as major nations skimp on aid
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 12:09:13 +0000
Content: It’s a simple but brutal equation: The number of people going hungry or otherwise struggling around the world is rising, while the amount of money the world’s wealthiest nations are contributing toward helping them is dropping.
The result: The United Nations says that, at best, it will be able to raise enough money to help about 60% of the 307 million people it predicts will need humanitarian aid next year. That means at least 117 million people won’t get food or other assistance in 2025.
The U.N. also will end 2024 having raised about 46% of the $49.6 billion it sought for humanitarian aid across the globe, its own data shows. It’s the second year in a row the world body has raised less than half of what it sought. The shortfall has forced humanitarian agencies to make agonizing decisions, such as slashing rations for the hungry and cutting the number of people eligible for aid.
The consequences are being felt in places like Syria, where the World Food Program (WFP), the U.N.’s main food distributor, used to feed 6 million people. Eyeing its projections for aid donations earlier this year, the WFP cut the number it hoped to help there to about 1 million people, said Rania Dagash-Kamara, the organization’s assistant executive director for partnerships and resource mobilization.
Dagash-Kamara visited the WFP’s Syria staff in March. “Their line was, ‘We are at this point taking from the hungry to feed the starving,’” she said in an interview.
U.N. officials see few reasons for optimism at a time of widespread conflict, political unrest and extreme weather, all factors that stoke famine. “We have been forced to scale back appeals to those in most dire need,” Tom Fletcher, U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, told Reporters.
Financial pressures and shifting domestic politics are reshaping some wealthy nations’ decisions about where and how much to give. One of the U.N.’s largest donors – Germany – already shaved $500 million in funding from 2023 to 2024 as part of general belt tightening. The country’s cabinet has recommended another $1 billion reduction in humanitarian aid for 2025. A new parliament will decide next year’s spending plan after the federal election in February.
Humanitarian organizations also are watching to see what U.S. President-elect Donald Trump proposes after he begins his second term in January.
Trump advisers have not said how he will approach humanitarian aid, but he sought to slash U.S. funding in his first term. And he has hired advisers who say there is room for cuts in foreign aid.
The U.S. plays the leading role in preventing and combating starvation across the world. It provided $64.5 billion in humanitarian aid over the last five years. That was at least 38% of the total such contributions recorded by the U.N.

Title: MHA forms tribunal to review ULFA’s status as an unlawful association
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 10:55:53 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has established an Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Tribunal to examine whether the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), including all its factions and front organizations, should continue to be classified as an unlawful association under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.
Headed by Justice Michael Zothankhuma of the Gauhati High Court, the tribunal’s formation follows the MHA’s recent extension of ULFA’s ban for five more years. The group has been accused of engaging in activities detrimental to India’s sovereignty, including extortion, violence, and collaboration with other insurgent groups to further its secessionist agenda.
Initially banned in 1990, ULFA’s prohibition has been periodically renewed, with the latest extension declared on November 27, 2024. The MHA, in its notification, stated that ULFA had continued its efforts to separate Assam from India, perpetrating criminal activities such as bombings and the illegal possession of arms. Between November 2019 and July 2024, ULFA was linked to 16 criminal cases, including the use of explosives ahead of Independence Day 2024.
In the past five years, the group has faced significant setbacks, with three of its hardcore members killed in security operations, 56 cadres arrested, and 63 surrendering. Additionally, authorities have recovered 27 weapons, 550 rounds of ammunition, nine grenades, and two improvised explosive devices (IEDs) from ULFA operatives.
ULFA remains one of 17 organizations declared unlawful under the UAPA. Other banned groups include the Popular Front of India (PFI), the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), and several extremist factions from Manipur, Tripura, Jammu and Kashmir, and Nagaland.

Title: Israel asks diplomats to seek Houthis’ listing as terrorists
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 10:14:28 +0000
Content: Israel has instructed its diplomatic missions in Europe to try to get the Iran-backed Houthi rebel group in Yemen designated as a terrorist organisation.
The Houthis have repeatedly fired drones and missiles towards Israel in what the group describes as acts of solidarity with Palestinians fighting Israeli forces in Gaza.
The attacks have disrupted international shipping routes, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys that have in turn stoked fears over global inflation.
“The Houthis pose a threat not only to Israel but also to the region and the entire world. The first and most basic thing to do is to designate them as a terrorist organization,” Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said in a statement.
The United States, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Israel currently designate the Houthis terrorists, according to Sa’ar.
The Israeli military on Saturday failed to intercept a missile from Yemen that fell in the Tel Aviv-Jaffa area, injuring 14 people.

Title: HM Amit Shah reviews implementation of new criminal laws in Uttarakhand
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 15:03:22 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah held a review meeting on Tuesday with Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, discussing the implementation of three new criminal laws in the state. The meeting focused on identifying and addressing gaps in technology and other areas necessary for their effective enforcement in all police stations.
During the session, the Home Minister assessed the status of various provisions related to police, jails, courts, prosecution, and forensic services in Uttarakhand. He emphasized the need for more forensic mobile vans, with a recommendation to have at least one additional van available in every district.
Amit Shah proposed that the Chief Minister conduct bi-weekly reviews on the progress of implementation, while the Chief Secretary and Director General of Police (DGP) should hold weekly meetings with officials from the concerned departments.
Senior officials, including the Union Home Secretary, Uttarakhand’s Chief Secretary, DGP, and heads from the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) and the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), along with representatives from the Ministry of Home Affairs and the state government, participated in the meeting.
The Home Minister urged the state government to prioritize swift implementation of the new laws in all police stations and jails, especially in areas where higher numbers of First Information Reports (FIRs) are registered. He recommended categorizing forensic team visits into three groups based on case severity to optimize resource utilization.
Shah also suggested formulating protocols for video conferencing and ensuring that cameras used for this purpose meet quality standards. He called for continuous monitoring of Zero FIRs, tracking how many cases have been resolved and how many have been transferred to other states.
The DGP was instructed to ensure that all Superintendents of Police adhere to prescribed timelines for case investigations. Shah stated that prompt implementation of the new laws would benefit victims and improve access to justice across the state.

Title: PM Modi meets economists ahead of Union Budget 2025-26
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 14:37:58 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a brainstorming session with economists and sectoral experts on Monday to gather views and suggestions for the Union Budget for 2025-26. The meeting was attended by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Suman Bery, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam, Chief Economic Advisor Anantha Nageswaran, and economists including Surjit Bhalla and DK Joshi.
This session comes as the government plans to continue investments in infrastructure projects aimed at boosting economic growth and employment. The Budget is scheduled to be presented in Parliament on February 1, 2025.
Government measures such as free foodgrain distribution and housing support for economically weaker sections in rural and urban areas remain focal points. Inflation, which has recently eased due to slowing food prices, has allowed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR) for banks from 4.5% to 4%. This reduction marks the first cut since March 2020 and is expected to inject ₹1.16 lakh crore into the banking system.
India, maintaining its position as a fast-growing major economy, is preparing for a budget that may focus on accelerating growth. Higher tax collections have contributed to fiscal stability. Net direct tax collections, including corporate and personal income taxes, rose by 15.4% to ₹12.1 lakh crore between April 1 and November 10, as per data from the Central Board of Direct Taxes.
Official figures show that the Centre’s fiscal deficit for the April-October period stood at 46.5% of the full-year target. The government aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.9% of GDP in the current financial year, compared to 5.6% in the previous year.
The government’s adherence to its fiscal consolidation plan, along with growing GST collections, has supported its financial standing. A controlled fiscal deficit reduces borrowing requirements and ensures liquidity in the banking system. This supports corporate investments and economic expansion, while keeping inflation rates stable.

Title: Uncertainty clouds fate of Syrians in Egypt after Assad ouster
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 13:53:45 +0000
Content: Syrian refugees and residents in Egypt face an uncertain future as new regulations may jeopardise their right to remain in the country after Bashar al-Assad’s ouster earlier this month.
European countries quickly suspended Syrian asylum applications after the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham swept into Damascus on Dec. 8, forcing Assad to flee after a 13-year civil war.
Other countries are also responding to the changing political landscape.
Egypt last week ratified a new law giving the government the power to determine refugee status. A decision has not been made on whether Syrians in Egypt would qualify as refugees under the new law, security sources told Reuters.
The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR estimates six million Syrians are living as refugees around the world, primarily in neighbouring countries. It expects 1 million to return in the next six months, but some Syrian refugees fear being forced to return home.
Egypt is also suspending the renewal of existing residency permits, held by many Syrians for tourism, education, or business, pending a security check, security sources told Reuters.
Syrian residents who spoke to Reuters were mostly unaware of the new rules, and many were also cautious about returning home.
“The situation there is not stable and we still do not know what will happen,” said Ahmed al-Akhras, owner of a car spare parts business, who said his children’s schooling and his shop were other reasons to stay.
He said his residency permit renewal was delayed so, like a number of other Syrians, he recently applied for UNHCR refugee status.
“If I go back to Syria, it won’t be now,” he said.
“We are afraid of the unknown, we don’t know who the new person that took over is, we don’t know the future,” said another Syrian who had been in Egypt for 12 years.
Residency decisions would be based on security considerations, the sources said. One cited concerns about Egypt’s own internal security after Assad’s replacement by the rebels.
REFUGEE ‘BURDEN’
Egypt has taken a diplomatic approach to the upheaval in Syria, but state-linked media have referred to the rebels as “terrorist” groups.
With Egypt tackling an economic crisis of its own, officials have often described refugees in the country, which they number at 10 million, as a burden.
The UNHCR puts the number of refugees in Egypt at around 800,000, including about 159,000 Syrians. Hundreds of thousands more Syrians have residency permits in Egypt, and many own businesses.
“There is no other country in the globe hosting this number of refugees while receiving the same treatment as Egyptian citizens despite the fact we are not a rich country,” Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told reporters last week, citing the absence of refugee camps and access to free education, healthcare, and subsidies.
“This law strikes a balance between upholding our international commitments, while preserving the national security of Egypt.”
The law, ratified on Dec. 17, transfers the asylum system to the government from the U.N., and allows the government to collect more data on the number of refugees.
“Of course, the increase in numbers of registered refugees will contribute in providing more aid (from the international community) to Egypt. This is not a bad thing,” said lawmaker Freddy Elbaiady.
The law includes provisions protecting refugee rights to work, health, and education and freedom from exploitation.
Rights groups have criticised the new law. They point out that the definition of a refugee is ambiguous, and authorities have the right to deport anyone they deem does not qualify.
While there was no sign of a sudden deportation of Syrians, it was likely Cairo would change its perception of Syrians as a group in need of protection as the situation stabilises, said Karim Ennara of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, an independent human rights organisation.
In response to questions by Reuters, the UNHCR said it would continue to advocate for clear asylum procedures in Egypt.

Title: Quantum tech, ANRF, women scientists rule Indian science sector in 2024: Centre
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 12:47:50 +0000
Content: Quantum technology, the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), and women scientists were key highlights of the Indian science sector in 2024, according to the Union government.
India’s global rankings in science and technology saw improvement. The country moved to 39th position on the Global Innovation Index (GII) 2024, reflecting advancements in innovation. Additionally, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Report 2023 placed India in the sixth position for intellectual property filings. The Network Readiness Index (NRI) 2024 reported that India climbed to 49th position, compared to its 79th ranking in 2019.
The ANRF Act, 2023, implemented from February 5, was aimed at enhancing research and innovation capabilities. Under ANRF initiatives in 2024, programmes such as the Prime Minister’s Early Career Research Grant, the EV Mission, and the Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR) were introduced. A scheme for Inclusivity Research Grant (IRG) was also launched.
The National Quantum Mission (NQM) received approval from the Union Cabinet with a total outlay of ₹6,003.65 crore over eight years. The mission seeks to develop scientific and industrial R&D and foster an ecosystem for quantum technology.
Geospatial technology initiatives progressed in 2024, with enhancements in data and infrastructure improving public services. The Geospatial Capacity Building programme initiated a spatial thinking initiative in schools, covering seven states, 49 districts, and 16 schools. The programme engaged 154 teachers and reached over 6,200 students.
Women’s participation in science also increased during the year. Over 340 women scientists benefitted from fellowship programmes, and more than 29,000 girls from Classes 9-12 participated in activities under the Vigyan Jyoti initiative across 300 districts in 34 states and union territories.
Efforts in climate change mitigation continued with the establishment of four new centres of excellence and initiatives such as risk mapping for floods and droughts.

Title: Global hunger crisis deepens as major nations skimp on aid
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 12:09:13 +0000
Content: It’s a simple but brutal equation: The number of people going hungry or otherwise struggling around the world is rising, while the amount of money the world’s wealthiest nations are contributing toward helping them is dropping.
The result: The United Nations says that, at best, it will be able to raise enough money to help about 60% of the 307 million people it predicts will need humanitarian aid next year. That means at least 117 million people won’t get food or other assistance in 2025.
The U.N. also will end 2024 having raised about 46% of the $49.6 billion it sought for humanitarian aid across the globe, its own data shows. It’s the second year in a row the world body has raised less than half of what it sought. The shortfall has forced humanitarian agencies to make agonizing decisions, such as slashing rations for the hungry and cutting the number of people eligible for aid.
The consequences are being felt in places like Syria, where the World Food Program (WFP), the U.N.’s main food distributor, used to feed 6 million people. Eyeing its projections for aid donations earlier this year, the WFP cut the number it hoped to help there to about 1 million people, said Rania Dagash-Kamara, the organization’s assistant executive director for partnerships and resource mobilization.
Dagash-Kamara visited the WFP’s Syria staff in March. “Their line was, ‘We are at this point taking from the hungry to feed the starving,’” she said in an interview.
U.N. officials see few reasons for optimism at a time of widespread conflict, political unrest and extreme weather, all factors that stoke famine. “We have been forced to scale back appeals to those in most dire need,” Tom Fletcher, U.N. under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, told Reporters.
Financial pressures and shifting domestic politics are reshaping some wealthy nations’ decisions about where and how much to give. One of the U.N.’s largest donors – Germany – already shaved $500 million in funding from 2023 to 2024 as part of general belt tightening. The country’s cabinet has recommended another $1 billion reduction in humanitarian aid for 2025. A new parliament will decide next year’s spending plan after the federal election in February.
Humanitarian organizations also are watching to see what U.S. President-elect Donald Trump proposes after he begins his second term in January.
Trump advisers have not said how he will approach humanitarian aid, but he sought to slash U.S. funding in his first term. And he has hired advisers who say there is room for cuts in foreign aid.
The U.S. plays the leading role in preventing and combating starvation across the world. It provided $64.5 billion in humanitarian aid over the last five years. That was at least 38% of the total such contributions recorded by the U.N.

Title: MHA forms tribunal to review ULFA’s status as an unlawful association
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 10:55:53 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) has established an Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Tribunal to examine whether the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA), including all its factions and front organizations, should continue to be classified as an unlawful association under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.
Headed by Justice Michael Zothankhuma of the Gauhati High Court, the tribunal’s formation follows the MHA’s recent extension of ULFA’s ban for five more years. The group has been accused of engaging in activities detrimental to India’s sovereignty, including extortion, violence, and collaboration with other insurgent groups to further its secessionist agenda.
Initially banned in 1990, ULFA’s prohibition has been periodically renewed, with the latest extension declared on November 27, 2024. The MHA, in its notification, stated that ULFA had continued its efforts to separate Assam from India, perpetrating criminal activities such as bombings and the illegal possession of arms. Between November 2019 and July 2024, ULFA was linked to 16 criminal cases, including the use of explosives ahead of Independence Day 2024.
In the past five years, the group has faced significant setbacks, with three of its hardcore members killed in security operations, 56 cadres arrested, and 63 surrendering. Additionally, authorities have recovered 27 weapons, 550 rounds of ammunition, nine grenades, and two improvised explosive devices (IEDs) from ULFA operatives.
ULFA remains one of 17 organizations declared unlawful under the UAPA. Other banned groups include the Popular Front of India (PFI), the National Democratic Front of Bodoland (NDFB), and several extremist factions from Manipur, Tripura, Jammu and Kashmir, and Nagaland.

Title: NRI remittances surge to record $11.9 billion in April-Oct: RBI
Publication Date: Wed, 25 Dec 2024 06:47:37 +0000
Content: Inflows into in non-resident Indian (NRI) deposit accounts surged to $11.9 billion in April-October during the current financial year, which is nearly twice the corresponding figure of $6.1 billion for the same period last year, the latest figures compiled by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) showed.
The total outstanding NRI deposits as of October 2024 has now gone up to $162.7 billion, compared to $143.5 billion during the same period last year.
The NRI deposit schemes include foreign currency non-resident (FCNR) deposits, non-resident external (NRE) deposits, and non-resident ordinary (NRO) deposits.
The figures also show that FCNR (B) deposits attracted the highest flows to the tune of $6.1 billion which is close to thrice the amount of $2.1 billion deposited in the same period last year. The total amount in these accounts stood at $31.87 billion.
These accounts are preferred by Indians working overseas as they can maintain fixed deposits from one to five years that enables them to earn higher interest. Since these accounts are in foreign currency these deposits are safeguarded against fluctuations in the rupee.
The RBI had raised the interest rate ceilings on FCNR (B) accounts in its monetary policy review earlier this month to attract more flows to increase the country’s foreign exchange reserves.
An increase in the foreign exchange reserves reflects strong fundamentals of the economy and gives the RBI more headroom to stabilise the rupee when it turns volatile.
A strong forex kitty enables the RBI to intervene in the spot and forward currency markets by releasing more dollars to prevent the rupee from going into a free fall. Conversely, a declining forex kitty leaves the RBI less space to intervene in the market to prop up the rupee.
The RBI figures also show that NRE deposits saw an inflow of $3.09 billion during this period, up from $1.95 billion in the same period last year.. NRE deposits are a high-interest earning rupee deposit option for NRI remittances.
NRO deposits rose to $2.66 billion during April-October compared to $2 billion during the corresponding period of the previous year.
India tops the list of recipient countries for remittances in 2024 with an estimated inflow of $129 billion, according to the latest figures compiled by World Bank economists.
The growth rate of remittances this year is estimated to be 5.8 per cent, compared to 1.2 per cent registered in 2023, according to a World Bank blog post
“The recovery of the job markets in the high-income countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, has been the key driver of remittances. This is especially true for the United States where the employment of foreign-born workers has recovered steadily and is 11 percent higher than the pre-pandemic level seen in February 2020,” the report said.

Title: A tribute to Atal Ji, the statesman who shaped India with his vision and resolve
Publication Date: Wed, 25 Dec 2024 05:41:53 +0000
Content: Today, 25th December is a very special day for all of us. Our nation marks the 100th Jayanti of our beloved former Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji. He stands tall as a statesman who continues to inspire countless people.
Our nation will always be grateful to Atal Ji for being the architect of India’s transition into the 21st century.
When he took oath as PM in 1998 our nation had passed through a period of political instability. In about 9 years, we had seen 4 Lok Sabha elections. The people of India were getting impatient and also sceptical about governments being able to deliver. It was Atal Ji who turned this tide by providing stable and effective governance. Coming from humble roots, he realised the struggles of the common citizen and the transformative power of effective governance.
One can see the long-term impact of Atal Ji’s leadership in so many sectors around us. His era marked a gigantic leap in the world of Information Technology, telecom and communications. This was particularly important for a nation like ours, which is also blessed with a very dynamic Yuva Shakti. The NDA Government under Atal Ji made the first serious attempt to make technology accessible to the common citizens. At the same time, there was foresight in connecting India. Even today, most people recall the Golden Quadrilateral Project, which connected the length and breadth of India. Equally notable were the Vajpayee Government’s efforts to enhance local connectivity as well through initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. Similarly, his Government gave a push to metro connectivity by doing extensive work for the Delhi Metro, which stands out as a world-class infrastructure project. Thus, the Vajpayee Government not only boosted economic growth but also brought distant regions closer, fostering unity and integration.
When it comes to the social sector, an initiative like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan highlights how Atal Ji dreamt of building an India where modern education is accessible to people across the nation, particularly for the poor and marginalised sections. At the same time, his government presided over many economic reforms which set the stage for India’s economic surge after several decades of following an economic philosophy which encouraged cronyism and stagnation.
A wonderful example of Vajpayee Ji’s leadership can be seen in the summer of 1998. His Government had just assumed office and on 11th May, India conducted the Pokhran tests, known as Operation Shakti. These tests exemplified the prowess of India’s scientific community. The world was stunned that India had done the tests and expressed their anger in no uncertain terms. Any ordinary leader would have buckled, but Atal Ji was made differently. And what happened? India stood firm and resolute with the government calling for another set of tests two days later, on 13th May! If the tests of the 11th showed scientific skill, the ones on 13th showed true leadership. It was a message to the world that gone were the days when India would buckle under threats or pressure. Despite facing international sanctions, the then NDA government of Vajpayee Ji stood firm, articulating India’s right to safeguard its sovereignty while simultaneously being the strongest proponent of world peace.
Atal Ji understood Indian democracy and also the need to make it stronger. Atal Ji presided over the creation of the NDA, which redefined coalitions in Indian politics. He brought people together and made NDA a force for development, national progress and regional ambitions. His Parliamentary brilliance was seen throughout his political journey. He belonged to a party with a handful of MPs but his words were enough to rattle the might of the all-powerful Congress Party that time. As Prime Minister, he blunted the criticisms of the Opposition with style and substance. His was a career spent largely in the Opposition benches but never carried any trace of bitterness against anyone, even though the Congress stooped to new lows by going to the extent of calling him a traitor!
He was also not one to cling on to power through opportunistic means. He preferred to resign in 1996 instead of following the path of horse-trading and dirty politics. In 1999, his Government was defeated by 1 vote. A lot of people told him to challenge the immoral politics happening then but he preferred to go by the rules. Eventually, he came back with another resounding mandate from the people.
When it comes to commitment to protecting our Constitution too, Atal Ji stands tall. He was deeply impacted by the martyrdom of Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee. Years later, he was a pillar of the anti-Emergency movement. In the run-up to the 1977 elections after the Emergency, he agreed to merger of his own Party (Jan Sangh) into the Janata Party. I am sure it would have been a painful decision for him and the others, but safeguarding the Constitution was all that mattered to him.
It is also noteworthy how deeply rooted Atal Ji was in Indian culture. Upon becoming India’s External Affairs Minister, he became the first Indian leader to speak in Hindi at the United Nations. This one gesture showcased his immense pride in India’s heritage and identity, leaving an indelible mark on the global stage.
Atal Ji’s persona was magnetic and his life was enriched by his love for literature and expression. A prolific writer and poet, he used words to inspire, provoke thought, and even offer solace. His poetry, often reflective of his inner struggles and hopes for the nation, continues to resonate with people across age groups.
For so many Bharatiya Janata Party Karyakartas like me, it is our privilege that we were able to learn and interact with a person like Atal Ji. His contribution to the BJP was foundational. In those days to spearhead an alternative narrative to the dominant Congress showed his greatness. Alongside stalwarts like Shri L.K. Advani Ji and Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi Ji he nurtured the party from its formative years, guiding it through challenges, setbacks and triumphs. Whenever the choice came between ideology and power, he always chose the former. He was able to convince the nation that an alternative world view from the Congress was possible and such a world view could deliver.
On his 100th Jayanti, let us rededicate ourselves to realising his ideals and fulfilling his vision for India. Let us strive to build an India that embodies his principles of good governance, unity, and progress. Atal Ji’s unwavering belief in the potential of our nation continues to inspire us to aim higher and work harder.

Title: Dense fog engulfs Delhi as air quality remains ‘very poor’
Publication Date: Wed, 25 Dec 2024 04:26:07 +0000
Content: Delhi woke up to dense fog on Wednesday morning, significantly reducing visibility. The overall Air Quality Index at 7 a.m. was recorded at 333, categorised as ‘very poor’, an improvement from the previous day’s ‘severe’ level.
According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the minimum temperature stood at nine degrees Celsius.
Due to the foggy condition 20 trains to Delhi from various parts of the country were running.
The Delhi Airport also issued an advisory for the passengers. It said that the flights that are not CAT III compliant may be affected and the passengers are requested to contact the airline for updated flight information.
Meanwhile, the air quality improvement in the national capital and surrounding areas was noted after the AQI dropped to 369 by 4 p.m. on December 24.
According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the AQI in Delhi’s key areas remained in the ‘very poor’ category as of 5 a.m. on Wednesday (December 25). Anand Vihar recorded an AQI of 366, Alipur recorded an AQI of 324, Ashok Vihar recorded an AQI of 373, and other key areas similarly reported AQI levels in the ‘very poor’ category.
Authorities have urged residents to remain cautious and follow guidelines to minimize pollution.
In response to worsening air quality earlier this month, Stage IV measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) were implemented on December 16 after AQI levels breached the 400 mark.
However, following gradual improvement, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) revoked these Stage IV restrictions on December 24. Despite this, measures under Stages I, II, and III will remain in effect to prevent further air quality degradation.
The CPCB’s AQI classification ranges from ‘good’ (0-50) to ‘severe plus’ (above 450), with Delhi’s current ‘very poor’ levels still posing health risks, particularly for vulnerable groups. As winter intensifies, air quality monitoring and preventive measures remain critical in the region.
Authorities continue to emphasise the need for public cooperation to mitigate pollution and sustain recent improvements. The National Capital is expected to experience mixed weather conditions in the coming week.

Title: HM Amit Shah reviews implementation of new criminal laws in Uttarakhand
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 15:03:22 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah held a review meeting on Tuesday with Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami, discussing the implementation of three new criminal laws in the state. The meeting focused on identifying and addressing gaps in technology and other areas necessary for their effective enforcement in all police stations.
During the session, the Home Minister assessed the status of various provisions related to police, jails, courts, prosecution, and forensic services in Uttarakhand. He emphasized the need for more forensic mobile vans, with a recommendation to have at least one additional van available in every district.
Amit Shah proposed that the Chief Minister conduct bi-weekly reviews on the progress of implementation, while the Chief Secretary and Director General of Police (DGP) should hold weekly meetings with officials from the concerned departments.
Senior officials, including the Union Home Secretary, Uttarakhand’s Chief Secretary, DGP, and heads from the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D) and the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), along with representatives from the Ministry of Home Affairs and the state government, participated in the meeting.
The Home Minister urged the state government to prioritize swift implementation of the new laws in all police stations and jails, especially in areas where higher numbers of First Information Reports (FIRs) are registered. He recommended categorizing forensic team visits into three groups based on case severity to optimize resource utilization.
Shah also suggested formulating protocols for video conferencing and ensuring that cameras used for this purpose meet quality standards. He called for continuous monitoring of Zero FIRs, tracking how many cases have been resolved and how many have been transferred to other states.
The DGP was instructed to ensure that all Superintendents of Police adhere to prescribed timelines for case investigations. Shah stated that prompt implementation of the new laws would benefit victims and improve access to justice across the state.

Title: PM Modi meets economists ahead of Union Budget 2025-26
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 14:37:58 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a brainstorming session with economists and sectoral experts on Monday to gather views and suggestions for the Union Budget for 2025-26. The meeting was attended by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Suman Bery, Niti Aayog CEO BVR Subrahmanyam, Chief Economic Advisor Anantha Nageswaran, and economists including Surjit Bhalla and DK Joshi.
This session comes as the government plans to continue investments in infrastructure projects aimed at boosting economic growth and employment. The Budget is scheduled to be presented in Parliament on February 1, 2025.
Government measures such as free foodgrain distribution and housing support for economically weaker sections in rural and urban areas remain focal points. Inflation, which has recently eased due to slowing food prices, has allowed the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR) for banks from 4.5% to 4%. This reduction marks the first cut since March 2020 and is expected to inject ₹1.16 lakh crore into the banking system.
India, maintaining its position as a fast-growing major economy, is preparing for a budget that may focus on accelerating growth. Higher tax collections have contributed to fiscal stability. Net direct tax collections, including corporate and personal income taxes, rose by 15.4% to ₹12.1 lakh crore between April 1 and November 10, as per data from the Central Board of Direct Taxes.
Official figures show that the Centre’s fiscal deficit for the April-October period stood at 46.5% of the full-year target. The government aims to reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.9% of GDP in the current financial year, compared to 5.6% in the previous year.
The government’s adherence to its fiscal consolidation plan, along with growing GST collections, has supported its financial standing. A controlled fiscal deficit reduces borrowing requirements and ensures liquidity in the banking system. This supports corporate investments and economic expansion, while keeping inflation rates stable.

Title: Uncertainty clouds fate of Syrians in Egypt after Assad ouster
Publication Date: Tue, 24 Dec 2024 13:53:45 +0000
Content: Syrian refugees and residents in Egypt face an uncertain future as new regulations may jeopardise their right to remain in the country after Bashar al-Assad’s ouster earlier this month.
European countries quickly suspended Syrian asylum applications after the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham swept into Damascus on Dec. 8, forcing Assad to flee after a 13-year civil war.
Other countries are also responding to the changing political landscape.
Egypt last week ratified a new law giving the government the power to determine refugee status. A decision has not been made on whether Syrians in Egypt would qualify as refugees under the new law, security sources told Reuters.
The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR estimates six million Syrians are living as refugees around the world, primarily in neighbouring countries. It expects 1 million to return in the next six months, but some Syrian refugees fear being forced to return home.
Egypt is also suspending the renewal of existing residency permits, held by many Syrians for tourism, education, or business, pending a security check, security sources told Reuters.
Syrian residents who spoke to Reuters were mostly unaware of the new rules, and many were also cautious about returning home.
“The situation there is not stable and we still do not know what will happen,” said Ahmed al-Akhras, owner of a car spare parts business, who said his children’s schooling and his shop were other reasons to stay.
He said his residency permit renewal was delayed so, like a number of other Syrians, he recently applied for UNHCR refugee status.
“If I go back to Syria, it won’t be now,” he said.
“We are afraid of the unknown, we don’t know who the new person that took over is, we don’t know the future,” said another Syrian who had been in Egypt for 12 years.
Residency decisions would be based on security considerations, the sources said. One cited concerns about Egypt’s own internal security after Assad’s replacement by the rebels.
REFUGEE ‘BURDEN’
Egypt has taken a diplomatic approach to the upheaval in Syria, but state-linked media have referred to the rebels as “terrorist” groups.
With Egypt tackling an economic crisis of its own, officials have often described refugees in the country, which they number at 10 million, as a burden.
The UNHCR puts the number of refugees in Egypt at around 800,000, including about 159,000 Syrians. Hundreds of thousands more Syrians have residency permits in Egypt, and many own businesses.
“There is no other country in the globe hosting this number of refugees while receiving the same treatment as Egyptian citizens despite the fact we are not a rich country,” Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told reporters last week, citing the absence of refugee camps and access to free education, healthcare, and subsidies.
“This law strikes a balance between upholding our international commitments, while preserving the national security of Egypt.”
The law, ratified on Dec. 17, transfers the asylum system to the government from the U.N., and allows the government to collect more data on the number of refugees.
“Of course, the increase in numbers of registered refugees will contribute in providing more aid (from the international community) to Egypt. This is not a bad thing,” said lawmaker Freddy Elbaiady.
The law includes provisions protecting refugee rights to work, health, and education and freedom from exploitation.
Rights groups have criticised the new law. They point out that the definition of a refugee is ambiguous, and authorities have the right to deport anyone they deem does not qualify.
While there was no sign of a sudden deportation of Syrians, it was likely Cairo would change its perception of Syrians as a group in need of protection as the situation stabilises, said Karim Ennara of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, an independent human rights organisation.
In response to questions by Reuters, the UNHCR said it would continue to advocate for clear asylum procedures in Egypt.

Title: Israeli army forces patients out of a north Gaza hospital, medics say
Publication Date: Wed, 25 Dec 2024 11:25:40 +0000
Content: Israeli troops forced the evacuation of the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza and many patients, some of them on foot, arrived at another hospital miles away in Gaza City, the territory’s health ministry said on Tuesday.
The Indonesian Hospital is one of the Gaza Strip’s few still partially functioning hospitals, on its northern edge, an area that has been under intense Israeli military pressure for nearly three months.
Israel says its operation around the three northern Gaza communities surrounding the hospital – Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia – is targeting Hamas militants.
Palestinians accuse Israel of seeking to permanently depopulate northern Gaza to create a buffer zone, which Israel denies.
Munir Al-Bursh, director of the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, said the Israeli army had ordered hospital officials to evacuate it on Monday, before storming it in the early hours of Tuesday and forcing those inside to leave.
He said two other medical facilities in northern Gaza, Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan Hospitals, were also subject to frequent assaults by Israeli troops operating in the area.
“Occupation forces have taken the three hospitals out of medical service because of the repeated attacks that undermined them and destroyed parts of them,” Bursh said in a statement.
The Israeli military said it was looking into the report.
Officials at the three hospitals have so far refused orders by Israel to evacuate their facilities or leave patients unattended since the new military offensive began on Oct. 5.
Israel says it has been facilitating the delivery of medical supplies, fuel and the transfer of patients to other hospitals in the enclave during that period in collaboration with international agencies such as the World Health Organization.
Hussam Abu Safiya, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital, said they resisted a new order by the army to evacuate hundreds of patients, their companions and staff, adding that the hospital has been under constant Israeli fire that damaged generators, oxygen pumps and parts of the building.
Israeli forces have operated in the vicinity of the hospital since Monday, medics said.
NEW STRIKES
Meanwhile, Israeli bombardment continued elsewhere in the enclave and medics said at least nine Palestinians, including a member of the civil emergency service, were killed in four separate military strikes across the enclave on Tuesday.
The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.
Israel’s campaign against Hamas has since killed more than 45,200 Palestinians, according to health officials in the Hamas-run enclave. Most of the population of 2.3 million has been displaced and much of Gaza is in ruins.
A fresh bid by mediators Egypt, Qatar and the United States to end the fighting and release Israeli and foreign hostages has gained momentum this month, though no breakthrough has yet been reported.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday said progress had been made in hostage negotiations with Hamas but that he did not know how much longer it would take to see the results.
Gaps between Israel and Hamas over a possible Gaza ceasefire have narrowed, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials’ remarks on Monday, though crucial differences have yet to be resolved.

Title: Ambedkar’s vision for country neglected by Congress, says PM Modi
Publication Date: Wed, 25 Dec 2024 09:35:27 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday accused the Congress of ‘disrespecting’ Dr B.R. Ambedkar and not giving him ‘credit’ for his vision for the country’s progress and his achievements.
Addressing a public gathering in Madhya Pradesh’s historical city Khajuraho, PM Modi said the Congress always sidelined Dr Ambedkar’s vision for the country. He said the party only gave credit to the members of one family.
PM Modi, who laid the foundation of the Ken-Betwa river linking project, said Dr Ambedkar was the first leader who gave a vision for ‘Jal Shakti’ after the country became free from British rule.
“Babasaheb Dr Ambedkar had realised the problem of water and he had given a vision for Jal Shakti. But, he wasn’t given credit for his vision and his achievements. Congress always disrespected Dr Ambedkar and gave all credit to one family,” PM Modi said.
He further stated that Dr Ambedkar was aware that without water the country can’t progress. “Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee decided to take Dr Ambedkar’s vision for Jal Shakti forward and therefore, he dreamed of a river interlining project. However, after 2004, the project got derailed,” PM Modi said.
The Prime Minister’s statement came at a time when BJP and Congress are indulging in a war of words over the recent speech of Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Parliament.
PM Modi laid the foundation stone of the Ken-Betwa River linking national project, the country’s first interlinking of rivers project under a national perspective plan. This project aims to provide irrigation facilities to various districts in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh benefitting lakhs of farmer families.
PM Modi also released a commemorative stamp and coin marking the 100th birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
He laid the foundation stone of 1153 Atal Gram Sushasan buildings. These buildings will play an important role in the practical conduct of work and responsibilities of Gram Panchayats leading to good governance at the local level.
Further, PM Modi inaugurated the Omkareshwar Floating Solar Project established at Omkareshwar in the Khandwa district of Madhya Pradesh.
In his address at the public gathering, PM Modi said Madhya Pradesh has witnessed growth in the past year under the leadership of Chief Minister Mohan Yadav.
He said the people of Madhya Pradesh have shown their trust in the BJP because of the good governance of the BJP government. “An analysis should be done on the governance system in BJP-ruling states and the other parties. I believe that BJP ruling states will be on top of good governance,” PM Modi said.
He said that during the Congress regime, projects used to be announced but most of those projects remained on paper for decades. He said the BJP government introduced every project after considering the future of the country.
“I have observed that several projects announced 30-40 years ago, could not be completed. On the side, the BJP government believes in 100 per execution. This is the basic difference between Congress and BJP’s governance system,” he added.
The Prime Minister said he would request the learned people, who are experts in analyzing, should study the 75 years (after Independence) of governance. “…Evaluation should be done once. 100-200 parameters of development, public interest, and good governance should be determined, and then check and analyse the work that was done where Congress, Left and Communists ran the governments and wherever BJP got the opportunity to run the government… I say with confidence that wherever BJP has got the opportunity to serve in the country, we have broken all the old records and have succeeded in carrying out the works of public interest, welfare and development… We toil day and night to make the dreams of freedom fighters come true…”
He criticised Congress, accusing it of not paying attention to the water crisis in Bundelkhand and other parts of the country.

Title: A tribute to Atal Ji, the statesman who shaped India with his vision and resolve
Publication Date: Wed, 25 Dec 2024 08:10:53 +0000
Content: Today, 25th December is a very special day for all of us. Our nation marks the 100th Jayanti of our beloved former Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji. He stands tall as a statesman who continues to inspire countless people.
Our nation will always be grateful to Atal Ji for being the architect of India’s transition into the 21st century.
When he took oath as PM in 1998 our nation had passed through a period of political instability. In about 9 years, we had seen 4 Lok Sabha elections. The people of India were getting impatient and also sceptical about governments being able to deliver. It was Atal Ji who turned this tide by providing stable and effective governance. Coming from humble roots, he realised the struggles of the common citizen and the transformative power of effective governance.
One can see the long-term impact of Atal Ji’s leadership in so many sectors around us. His era marked a gigantic leap in the world of Information Technology, telecom and communications. This was particularly important for a nation like ours, which is also blessed with a very dynamic Yuva Shakti. The NDA Government under Atal Ji made the first serious attempt to make technology accessible to the common citizens. At the same time, there was foresight in connecting India. Even today, most people recall the Golden Quadrilateral Project, which connected the length and breadth of India. Equally notable were the Vajpayee Government’s efforts to enhance local connectivity as well through initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. Similarly, his Government gave a push to metro connectivity by doing extensive work for the Delhi Metro, which stands out as a world-class infrastructure project. Thus, the Vajpayee Government not only boosted economic growth but also brought distant regions closer, fostering unity and integration.
When it comes to the social sector, an initiative like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan highlights how Atal Ji dreamt of building an India where modern education is accessible to people across the nation, particularly for the poor and marginalised sections. At the same time, his government presided over many economic reforms which set the stage for India’s economic surge after several decades of following an economic philosophy which encouraged cronyism and stagnation.
A wonderful example of Vajpayee Ji’s leadership can be seen in the summer of 1998. His Government had just assumed office and on 11th May, India conducted the Pokhran tests, known as Operation Shakti. These tests exemplified the prowess of India’s scientific community. The world was stunned that India had done the tests and expressed their anger in no uncertain terms. Any ordinary leader would have buckled, but Atal Ji was made differently. And what happened? India stood firm and resolute with the government calling for another set of tests two days later, on 13th May! If the tests of the 11th showed scientific skill, the ones on 13th showed true leadership. It was a message to the world that gone were the days when India would buckle under threats or pressure. Despite facing international sanctions, the then NDA government of Vajpayee Ji stood firm, articulating India’s right to safeguard its sovereignty while simultaneously being the strongest proponent of world peace.
Atal Ji understood Indian democracy and also the need to make it stronger. Atal Ji presided over the creation of the NDA, which redefined coalitions in Indian politics. He brought people together and made NDA a force for development, national progress and regional ambitions. His Parliamentary brilliance was seen throughout his political journey. He belonged to a party with a handful of MPs but his words were enough to rattle the might of the all-powerful Congress Party that time. As Prime Minister, he blunted the criticisms of the Opposition with style and substance. His was a career spent largely in the Opposition benches but never carried any trace of bitterness against anyone, even though the Congress stooped to new lows by going to the extent of calling him a traitor!
He was also not one to cling on to power through opportunistic means. He preferred to resign in 1996 instead of following the path of horse-trading and dirty politics. In 1999, his Government was defeated by 1 vote. A lot of people told him to challenge the immoral politics happening then but he preferred to go by the rules. Eventually, he came back with another resounding mandate from the people.
When it comes to commitment to protecting our Constitution too, Atal Ji stands tall. He was deeply impacted by the martyrdom of Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee. Years later, he was a pillar of the anti-Emergency movement. In the run-up to the 1977 elections after the Emergency, he agreed to merger of his own Party (Jan Sangh) into the Janata Party. I am sure it would have been a painful decision for him and the others, but safeguarding the Constitution was all that mattered to him.
It is also noteworthy how deeply rooted Atal Ji was in Indian culture. Upon becoming India’s External Affairs Minister, he became the first Indian leader to speak in Hindi at the United Nations. This one gesture showcased his immense pride in India’s heritage and identity, leaving an indelible mark on the global stage.
Atal Ji’s persona was magnetic and his life was enriched by his love for literature and expression. A prolific writer and poet, he used words to inspire, provoke thought, and even offer solace. His poetry, often reflective of his inner struggles and hopes for the nation, continues to resonate with people across age groups.
For so many Bharatiya Janata Party Karyakartas like me, it is our privilege that we were able to learn and interact with a person like Atal Ji. His contribution to the BJP was foundational. In those days to spearhead an alternative narrative to the dominant Congress showed his greatness. Alongside stalwarts like Shri L.K. Advani Ji and Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi Ji he nurtured the party from its formative years, guiding it through challenges, setbacks and triumphs. Whenever the choice came between ideology and power, he always chose the former. He was able to convince the nation that an alternative world view from the Congress was possible and such a world view could deliver.
On his 100th Jayanti, let us rededicate ourselves to realising his ideals and fulfilling his vision for India. Let us strive to build an India that embodies his principles of good governance, unity, and progress. Atal Ji’s unwavering belief in the potential of our nation continues to inspire us to aim higher and work harder.

Title: Russia attacks Ukraine energy system in major missile strike, Kyiv says
Publication Date: Wed, 25 Dec 2024 07:40:32 +0000
Content: Russia attacked Ukraine’s energy system and cities in its eastern region with cruise and ballistic missiles on Wednesday morning, Ukraine’s energy minister and local officials said.
At least three people were wounded in a missile attack on Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine on Wednesday morning, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said.
Ukrainian air forces said Kharkiv was attacked by ballistic missiles and regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said on the Telegram messaging app that there were “damages to civilian non-residential infrastructure”.
Separately, Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram: “Since the morning, the Russian army has been massively attacking the Dnipro region. It is trying to destroy the region’s power system.”
Ukraine’s energy minister German Galushchenko said on Facebook that Russia “is massively attacking the power sector” and that the transmission system operator had imposed restrictions on electricity supply to minimise the impact.
Russia has intensified its attacks on the Ukrainian energy sector since spring 2004, damaging almost half of its generating capacity and causing hours-long blackouts throughout the country.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Ukrainian military launched a countrywide air alert in response to Russian cruise missile launches.
Local authorities and the air force reported missile overflights in the eastern, central, southern and western regions.
During a previous massive missile attack on Nov. 17, Russia launched 120 missiles and 90 drones, killing at least seven people and causing severe damage to the power system.
Power distributor DTEK imposed emergency power cuts of up to eight hours across large parts of Ukraine.

Title: NRI remittances surge to record $11.9 billion in April-Oct: RBI
Publication Date: Wed, 25 Dec 2024 06:47:37 +0000
Content: Inflows into in non-resident Indian (NRI) deposit accounts surged to $11.9 billion in April-October during the current financial year, which is nearly twice the corresponding figure of $6.1 billion for the same period last year, the latest figures compiled by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) showed.
The total outstanding NRI deposits as of October 2024 has now gone up to $162.7 billion, compared to $143.5 billion during the same period last year.
The NRI deposit schemes include foreign currency non-resident (FCNR) deposits, non-resident external (NRE) deposits, and non-resident ordinary (NRO) deposits.
The figures also show that FCNR (B) deposits attracted the highest flows to the tune of $6.1 billion which is close to thrice the amount of $2.1 billion deposited in the same period last year. The total amount in these accounts stood at $31.87 billion.
These accounts are preferred by Indians working overseas as they can maintain fixed deposits from one to five years that enables them to earn higher interest. Since these accounts are in foreign currency these deposits are safeguarded against fluctuations in the rupee.
The RBI had raised the interest rate ceilings on FCNR (B) accounts in its monetary policy review earlier this month to attract more flows to increase the country’s foreign exchange reserves.
An increase in the foreign exchange reserves reflects strong fundamentals of the economy and gives the RBI more headroom to stabilise the rupee when it turns volatile.
A strong forex kitty enables the RBI to intervene in the spot and forward currency markets by releasing more dollars to prevent the rupee from going into a free fall. Conversely, a declining forex kitty leaves the RBI less space to intervene in the market to prop up the rupee.
The RBI figures also show that NRE deposits saw an inflow of $3.09 billion during this period, up from $1.95 billion in the same period last year.. NRE deposits are a high-interest earning rupee deposit option for NRI remittances.
NRO deposits rose to $2.66 billion during April-October compared to $2 billion during the corresponding period of the previous year.
India tops the list of recipient countries for remittances in 2024 with an estimated inflow of $129 billion, according to the latest figures compiled by World Bank economists.
The growth rate of remittances this year is estimated to be 5.8 per cent, compared to 1.2 per cent registered in 2023, according to a World Bank blog post
“The recovery of the job markets in the high-income countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, has been the key driver of remittances. This is especially true for the United States where the employment of foreign-born workers has recovered steadily and is 11 percent higher than the pre-pandemic level seen in February 2020,” the report said.

Title: Dense fog engulfs Delhi as air quality remains ‘very poor’
Publication Date: Wed, 25 Dec 2024 04:26:07 +0000
Content: Delhi woke up to dense fog on Wednesday morning, significantly reducing visibility. The overall Air Quality Index at 7 a.m. was recorded at 333, categorised as ‘very poor’, an improvement from the previous day’s ‘severe’ level.
According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the minimum temperature stood at nine degrees Celsius.
Due to the foggy condition 20 trains to Delhi from various parts of the country were running.
The Delhi Airport also issued an advisory for the passengers. It said that the flights that are not CAT III compliant may be affected and the passengers are requested to contact the airline for updated flight information.
Meanwhile, the air quality improvement in the national capital and surrounding areas was noted after the AQI dropped to 369 by 4 p.m. on December 24.
According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the AQI in Delhi’s key areas remained in the ‘very poor’ category as of 5 a.m. on Wednesday (December 25). Anand Vihar recorded an AQI of 366, Alipur recorded an AQI of 324, Ashok Vihar recorded an AQI of 373, and other key areas similarly reported AQI levels in the ‘very poor’ category.
Authorities have urged residents to remain cautious and follow guidelines to minimize pollution.
In response to worsening air quality earlier this month, Stage IV measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) were implemented on December 16 after AQI levels breached the 400 mark.
However, following gradual improvement, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) revoked these Stage IV restrictions on December 24. Despite this, measures under Stages I, II, and III will remain in effect to prevent further air quality degradation.
The CPCB’s AQI classification ranges from ‘good’ (0-50) to ‘severe plus’ (above 450), with Delhi’s current ‘very poor’ levels still posing health risks, particularly for vulnerable groups. As winter intensifies, air quality monitoring and preventive measures remain critical in the region.
Authorities continue to emphasise the need for public cooperation to mitigate pollution and sustain recent improvements. The National Capital is expected to experience mixed weather conditions in the coming week.

Title: Development of North East by Modi government

Title: Israeli army forces patients out of a north Gaza hospital, medics say
Publication Date: Wed, 25 Dec 2024 11:25:40 +0000
Content: Israeli troops forced the evacuation of the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza and many patients, some of them on foot, arrived at another hospital miles away in Gaza City, the territory’s health ministry said on Tuesday.
The Indonesian Hospital is one of the Gaza Strip’s few still partially functioning hospitals, on its northern edge, an area that has been under intense Israeli military pressure for nearly three months.
Israel says its operation around the three northern Gaza communities surrounding the hospital – Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia – is targeting Hamas militants.
Palestinians accuse Israel of seeking to permanently depopulate northern Gaza to create a buffer zone, which Israel denies.
Munir Al-Bursh, director of the health ministry in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip, said the Israeli army had ordered hospital officials to evacuate it on Monday, before storming it in the early hours of Tuesday and forcing those inside to leave.
He said two other medical facilities in northern Gaza, Al-Awda and Kamal Adwan Hospitals, were also subject to frequent assaults by Israeli troops operating in the area.
“Occupation forces have taken the three hospitals out of medical service because of the repeated attacks that undermined them and destroyed parts of them,” Bursh said in a statement.
The Israeli military said it was looking into the report.
Officials at the three hospitals have so far refused orders by Israel to evacuate their facilities or leave patients unattended since the new military offensive began on Oct. 5.
Israel says it has been facilitating the delivery of medical supplies, fuel and the transfer of patients to other hospitals in the enclave during that period in collaboration with international agencies such as the World Health Organization.
Hussam Abu Safiya, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital, said they resisted a new order by the army to evacuate hundreds of patients, their companions and staff, adding that the hospital has been under constant Israeli fire that damaged generators, oxygen pumps and parts of the building.
Israeli forces have operated in the vicinity of the hospital since Monday, medics said.
NEW STRIKES
Meanwhile, Israeli bombardment continued elsewhere in the enclave and medics said at least nine Palestinians, including a member of the civil emergency service, were killed in four separate military strikes across the enclave on Tuesday.
The war in Gaza was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.
Israel’s campaign against Hamas has since killed more than 45,200 Palestinians, according to health officials in the Hamas-run enclave. Most of the population of 2.3 million has been displaced and much of Gaza is in ruins.
A fresh bid by mediators Egypt, Qatar and the United States to end the fighting and release Israeli and foreign hostages has gained momentum this month, though no breakthrough has yet been reported.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday said progress had been made in hostage negotiations with Hamas but that he did not know how much longer it would take to see the results.
Gaps between Israel and Hamas over a possible Gaza ceasefire have narrowed, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials’ remarks on Monday, though crucial differences have yet to be resolved.

Title: Ambedkar’s vision for country neglected by Congress, says PM Modi
Publication Date: Wed, 25 Dec 2024 09:35:27 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday accused the Congress of ‘disrespecting’ Dr B.R. Ambedkar and not giving him ‘credit’ for his vision for the country’s progress and his achievements.
Addressing a public gathering in Madhya Pradesh’s historical city Khajuraho, PM Modi said the Congress always sidelined Dr Ambedkar’s vision for the country. He said the party only gave credit to the members of one family.
PM Modi, who laid the foundation of the Ken-Betwa river linking project, said Dr Ambedkar was the first leader who gave a vision for ‘Jal Shakti’ after the country became free from British rule.
“Babasaheb Dr Ambedkar had realised the problem of water and he had given a vision for Jal Shakti. But, he wasn’t given credit for his vision and his achievements. Congress always disrespected Dr Ambedkar and gave all credit to one family,” PM Modi said.
He further stated that Dr Ambedkar was aware that without water the country can’t progress. “Former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee decided to take Dr Ambedkar’s vision for Jal Shakti forward and therefore, he dreamed of a river interlining project. However, after 2004, the project got derailed,” PM Modi said.
The Prime Minister’s statement came at a time when BJP and Congress are indulging in a war of words over the recent speech of Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Parliament.
PM Modi laid the foundation stone of the Ken-Betwa River linking national project, the country’s first interlinking of rivers project under a national perspective plan. This project aims to provide irrigation facilities to various districts in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh benefitting lakhs of farmer families.
PM Modi also released a commemorative stamp and coin marking the 100th birth anniversary of former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
He laid the foundation stone of 1153 Atal Gram Sushasan buildings. These buildings will play an important role in the practical conduct of work and responsibilities of Gram Panchayats leading to good governance at the local level.
Further, PM Modi inaugurated the Omkareshwar Floating Solar Project established at Omkareshwar in the Khandwa district of Madhya Pradesh.
In his address at the public gathering, PM Modi said Madhya Pradesh has witnessed growth in the past year under the leadership of Chief Minister Mohan Yadav.
He said the people of Madhya Pradesh have shown their trust in the BJP because of the good governance of the BJP government. “An analysis should be done on the governance system in BJP-ruling states and the other parties. I believe that BJP ruling states will be on top of good governance,” PM Modi said.
He said that during the Congress regime, projects used to be announced but most of those projects remained on paper for decades. He said the BJP government introduced every project after considering the future of the country.
“I have observed that several projects announced 30-40 years ago, could not be completed. On the side, the BJP government believes in 100 per execution. This is the basic difference between Congress and BJP’s governance system,” he added.
The Prime Minister said he would request the learned people, who are experts in analyzing, should study the 75 years (after Independence) of governance. “…Evaluation should be done once. 100-200 parameters of development, public interest, and good governance should be determined, and then check and analyse the work that was done where Congress, Left and Communists ran the governments and wherever BJP got the opportunity to run the government… I say with confidence that wherever BJP has got the opportunity to serve in the country, we have broken all the old records and have succeeded in carrying out the works of public interest, welfare and development… We toil day and night to make the dreams of freedom fighters come true…”
He criticised Congress, accusing it of not paying attention to the water crisis in Bundelkhand and other parts of the country.

Title: A tribute to Atal Ji, the statesman who shaped India with his vision and resolve
Publication Date: Wed, 25 Dec 2024 08:10:53 +0000
Content: Today, 25th December is a very special day for all of us. Our nation marks the 100th Jayanti of our beloved former Prime Minister, Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ji. He stands tall as a statesman who continues to inspire countless people.
Our nation will always be grateful to Atal Ji for being the architect of India’s transition into the 21st century.
When he took oath as PM in 1998 our nation had passed through a period of political instability. In about 9 years, we had seen 4 Lok Sabha elections. The people of India were getting impatient and also sceptical about governments being able to deliver. It was Atal Ji who turned this tide by providing stable and effective governance. Coming from humble roots, he realised the struggles of the common citizen and the transformative power of effective governance.
One can see the long-term impact of Atal Ji’s leadership in so many sectors around us. His era marked a gigantic leap in the world of Information Technology, telecom and communications. This was particularly important for a nation like ours, which is also blessed with a very dynamic Yuva Shakti. The NDA Government under Atal Ji made the first serious attempt to make technology accessible to the common citizens. At the same time, there was foresight in connecting India. Even today, most people recall the Golden Quadrilateral Project, which connected the length and breadth of India. Equally notable were the Vajpayee Government’s efforts to enhance local connectivity as well through initiatives like the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana. Similarly, his Government gave a push to metro connectivity by doing extensive work for the Delhi Metro, which stands out as a world-class infrastructure project. Thus, the Vajpayee Government not only boosted economic growth but also brought distant regions closer, fostering unity and integration.
When it comes to the social sector, an initiative like the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan highlights how Atal Ji dreamt of building an India where modern education is accessible to people across the nation, particularly for the poor and marginalised sections. At the same time, his government presided over many economic reforms which set the stage for India’s economic surge after several decades of following an economic philosophy which encouraged cronyism and stagnation.
A wonderful example of Vajpayee Ji’s leadership can be seen in the summer of 1998. His Government had just assumed office and on 11th May, India conducted the Pokhran tests, known as Operation Shakti. These tests exemplified the prowess of India’s scientific community. The world was stunned that India had done the tests and expressed their anger in no uncertain terms. Any ordinary leader would have buckled, but Atal Ji was made differently. And what happened? India stood firm and resolute with the government calling for another set of tests two days later, on 13th May! If the tests of the 11th showed scientific skill, the ones on 13th showed true leadership. It was a message to the world that gone were the days when India would buckle under threats or pressure. Despite facing international sanctions, the then NDA government of Vajpayee Ji stood firm, articulating India’s right to safeguard its sovereignty while simultaneously being the strongest proponent of world peace.
Atal Ji understood Indian democracy and also the need to make it stronger. Atal Ji presided over the creation of the NDA, which redefined coalitions in Indian politics. He brought people together and made NDA a force for development, national progress and regional ambitions. His Parliamentary brilliance was seen throughout his political journey. He belonged to a party with a handful of MPs but his words were enough to rattle the might of the all-powerful Congress Party that time. As Prime Minister, he blunted the criticisms of the Opposition with style and substance. His was a career spent largely in the Opposition benches but never carried any trace of bitterness against anyone, even though the Congress stooped to new lows by going to the extent of calling him a traitor!
He was also not one to cling on to power through opportunistic means. He preferred to resign in 1996 instead of following the path of horse-trading and dirty politics. In 1999, his Government was defeated by 1 vote. A lot of people told him to challenge the immoral politics happening then but he preferred to go by the rules. Eventually, he came back with another resounding mandate from the people.
When it comes to commitment to protecting our Constitution too, Atal Ji stands tall. He was deeply impacted by the martyrdom of Dr. Syama Prasad Mookerjee. Years later, he was a pillar of the anti-Emergency movement. In the run-up to the 1977 elections after the Emergency, he agreed to merger of his own Party (Jan Sangh) into the Janata Party. I am sure it would have been a painful decision for him and the others, but safeguarding the Constitution was all that mattered to him.
It is also noteworthy how deeply rooted Atal Ji was in Indian culture. Upon becoming India’s External Affairs Minister, he became the first Indian leader to speak in Hindi at the United Nations. This one gesture showcased his immense pride in India’s heritage and identity, leaving an indelible mark on the global stage.
Atal Ji’s persona was magnetic and his life was enriched by his love for literature and expression. A prolific writer and poet, he used words to inspire, provoke thought, and even offer solace. His poetry, often reflective of his inner struggles and hopes for the nation, continues to resonate with people across age groups.
For so many Bharatiya Janata Party Karyakartas like me, it is our privilege that we were able to learn and interact with a person like Atal Ji. His contribution to the BJP was foundational. In those days to spearhead an alternative narrative to the dominant Congress showed his greatness. Alongside stalwarts like Shri L.K. Advani Ji and Dr. Murli Manohar Joshi Ji he nurtured the party from its formative years, guiding it through challenges, setbacks and triumphs. Whenever the choice came between ideology and power, he always chose the former. He was able to convince the nation that an alternative world view from the Congress was possible and such a world view could deliver.
On his 100th Jayanti, let us rededicate ourselves to realising his ideals and fulfilling his vision for India. Let us strive to build an India that embodies his principles of good governance, unity, and progress. Atal Ji’s unwavering belief in the potential of our nation continues to inspire us to aim higher and work harder.

Title: Russia attacks Ukraine energy system in major missile strike, Kyiv says
Publication Date: Wed, 25 Dec 2024 07:40:32 +0000
Content: Russia attacked Ukraine’s energy system and cities in its eastern region with cruise and ballistic missiles on Wednesday morning, Ukraine’s energy minister and local officials said.
At least three people were wounded in a missile attack on Kharkiv in northeastern Ukraine on Wednesday morning, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said.
Ukrainian air forces said Kharkiv was attacked by ballistic missiles and regional governor Oleh Syniehubov said on the Telegram messaging app that there were “damages to civilian non-residential infrastructure”.
Separately, Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram: “Since the morning, the Russian army has been massively attacking the Dnipro region. It is trying to destroy the region’s power system.”
Ukraine’s energy minister German Galushchenko said on Facebook that Russia “is massively attacking the power sector” and that the transmission system operator had imposed restrictions on electricity supply to minimise the impact.
Russia has intensified its attacks on the Ukrainian energy sector since spring 2004, damaging almost half of its generating capacity and causing hours-long blackouts throughout the country.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Ukrainian military launched a countrywide air alert in response to Russian cruise missile launches.
Local authorities and the air force reported missile overflights in the eastern, central, southern and western regions.
During a previous massive missile attack on Nov. 17, Russia launched 120 missiles and 90 drones, killing at least seven people and causing severe damage to the power system.
Power distributor DTEK imposed emergency power cuts of up to eight hours across large parts of Ukraine.

Title: NRI remittances surge to record $11.9 billion in April-Oct: RBI
Publication Date: Wed, 25 Dec 2024 06:47:37 +0000
Content: Inflows into in non-resident Indian (NRI) deposit accounts surged to $11.9 billion in April-October during the current financial year, which is nearly twice the corresponding figure of $6.1 billion for the same period last year, the latest figures compiled by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) showed.
The total outstanding NRI deposits as of October 2024 has now gone up to $162.7 billion, compared to $143.5 billion during the same period last year.
The NRI deposit schemes include foreign currency non-resident (FCNR) deposits, non-resident external (NRE) deposits, and non-resident ordinary (NRO) deposits.
The figures also show that FCNR (B) deposits attracted the highest flows to the tune of $6.1 billion which is close to thrice the amount of $2.1 billion deposited in the same period last year. The total amount in these accounts stood at $31.87 billion.
These accounts are preferred by Indians working overseas as they can maintain fixed deposits from one to five years that enables them to earn higher interest. Since these accounts are in foreign currency these deposits are safeguarded against fluctuations in the rupee.
The RBI had raised the interest rate ceilings on FCNR (B) accounts in its monetary policy review earlier this month to attract more flows to increase the country’s foreign exchange reserves.
An increase in the foreign exchange reserves reflects strong fundamentals of the economy and gives the RBI more headroom to stabilise the rupee when it turns volatile.
A strong forex kitty enables the RBI to intervene in the spot and forward currency markets by releasing more dollars to prevent the rupee from going into a free fall. Conversely, a declining forex kitty leaves the RBI less space to intervene in the market to prop up the rupee.
The RBI figures also show that NRE deposits saw an inflow of $3.09 billion during this period, up from $1.95 billion in the same period last year.. NRE deposits are a high-interest earning rupee deposit option for NRI remittances.
NRO deposits rose to $2.66 billion during April-October compared to $2 billion during the corresponding period of the previous year.
India tops the list of recipient countries for remittances in 2024 with an estimated inflow of $129 billion, according to the latest figures compiled by World Bank economists.
The growth rate of remittances this year is estimated to be 5.8 per cent, compared to 1.2 per cent registered in 2023, according to a World Bank blog post
“The recovery of the job markets in the high-income countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, has been the key driver of remittances. This is especially true for the United States where the employment of foreign-born workers has recovered steadily and is 11 percent higher than the pre-pandemic level seen in February 2020,” the report said.

Title: Dense fog engulfs Delhi as air quality remains ‘very poor’
Publication Date: Wed, 25 Dec 2024 04:26:07 +0000
Content: Delhi woke up to dense fog on Wednesday morning, significantly reducing visibility. The overall Air Quality Index at 7 a.m. was recorded at 333, categorised as ‘very poor’, an improvement from the previous day’s ‘severe’ level.
According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the minimum temperature stood at nine degrees Celsius.
Due to the foggy condition 20 trains to Delhi from various parts of the country were running.
The Delhi Airport also issued an advisory for the passengers. It said that the flights that are not CAT III compliant may be affected and the passengers are requested to contact the airline for updated flight information.
Meanwhile, the air quality improvement in the national capital and surrounding areas was noted after the AQI dropped to 369 by 4 p.m. on December 24.
According to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) data, the AQI in Delhi’s key areas remained in the ‘very poor’ category as of 5 a.m. on Wednesday (December 25). Anand Vihar recorded an AQI of 366, Alipur recorded an AQI of 324, Ashok Vihar recorded an AQI of 373, and other key areas similarly reported AQI levels in the ‘very poor’ category.
Authorities have urged residents to remain cautious and follow guidelines to minimize pollution.
In response to worsening air quality earlier this month, Stage IV measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) were implemented on December 16 after AQI levels breached the 400 mark.
However, following gradual improvement, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) revoked these Stage IV restrictions on December 24. Despite this, measures under Stages I, II, and III will remain in effect to prevent further air quality degradation.
The CPCB’s AQI classification ranges from ‘good’ (0-50) to ‘severe plus’ (above 450), with Delhi’s current ‘very poor’ levels still posing health risks, particularly for vulnerable groups. As winter intensifies, air quality monitoring and preventive measures remain critical in the region.
Authorities continue to emphasise the need for public cooperation to mitigate pollution and sustain recent improvements. The National Capital is expected to experience mixed weather conditions in the coming week.

Title: AI can help identify and manage atopic dermatitis: report
Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 07:29:33 +0000
Content: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is emerging as a valuable tool in the diagnosis and management of atopic dermatitis, a chronic skin condition. AI can enable more accurate, early, and standardized identification, optimizing patient outcomes, according to a report released on Thursday.
Atopic dermatitis is a complex disease with a range of clinical manifestations and symptoms. In severe cases, it is associated with sleep disturbances due to pruritic rashes that appear on the skin during flare-ups, along with depression, anxiety, and loss of productivity.
Effective management of atopic dermatitis has long been a priority for physicians, as the quality of life for patients is compromised due to disruptive symptoms like itchiness and skin inflammation.
As the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis is primarily clinical, it can be subjective, leading to variability in diagnosis. In the era of AI, several trends have emerged across various sectors, with healthcare being one of the most impacted.
The report from GlobalData, a data and analytics company, highlighted that the lack of objective biomarkers for definitive diagnosis and severity assessment of chronic skin diseases complicates the diagnostic process.
“AI offers innovative solutions to challenges in healthcare by simulating human intelligence in machines, with advancements paving the way for significant improvements in diagnostics, drug discovery, and personalized medicine,” said Filippos Maniatis, a Healthcare Analyst at GlobalData.
“AI-powered image recognition can determine characteristic patterns of severity in skin lesion images, and, through machine training, improve diagnostic accuracy over time,” Maniatis added.
Studies suggest that AI can facilitate more personalized treatment plans, continuous monitoring, and leveraging technological advancements for better disease management. For example, wearable devices equipped with AI technology could offer real-time data for ongoing monitoring of skin conditions.
Wearable devices with AI help in continuous monitoring, enabling physicians to make timely adjustments to treatment plans based on changes in disease severity, such as flare-ups. This technology has already attracted the attention of multiple tech companies, the report noted.
“These technologies highlight the potential to improve the current diagnosis and management of atopic dermatitis. Collaborative efforts between AI specialists, clinicians, and researchers are essential to fully understanding AI’s potential in improving disease management,” Maniatis concluded.

Title: Azerbaijan Airlines plane crashes in Kazakhstan, killing 38
Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 06:58:51 +0000
Content: An Embraer passenger jet crashed near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan on Wednesday, killing 38 people, after diverting from an area of Russia that Moscow has recently defended against Ukrainian drone attacks.
Twenty-nine survivors received hospital treatment.
Azerbaijan Airlines flight J2-8243 had flown hundreds of miles off its scheduled route from Azerbaijan to Russia to crash on the opposite shore of the Caspian Sea, after what Russia’s aviation watchdog said was an emergency that may have been caused by a bird strike. But an aviation expert suggested that cause seemed unlikely.
Officials did not immediately explain why it had crossed the sea, but the crash came after Ukrainian drone strikes this month hit the Chechnya region of southern Russia. The nearest Russian airport on the plane’s flight path was closed on Wednesday morning.
Kyiv has not acknowledged strikes this month on the Chechen city of Grozny, where the flight was headed.
Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev said according to information he had received, the plane changed course due to poor weather, but he added the cause of the crash was unknown and must be fully investigated.
“This is a great tragedy that has become a tremendous sorrow for the Azerbaijani people,” he said.
Video of the crash showed the plane descending rapidly before bursting into flames as it hit the seashore, and thick black smoke then rising. Bloodied and bruised passengers could be seen stumbling from a piece of the fuselage that had remained intact.

Reuters was able to verify from visible landmarks that the video was filmed on the Caspian shore near Aktau.
Sixty-two passengers and five crew were aboard. The death toll was disclosed by Deputy Prime Minister Kanat Bozumbayev in a meeting with an Azerbaijani delegation in Aktau, Russian news agency Interfax reported.
Kazakhstan’s emergencies ministry said in a statement that fire services had put out the blaze and that the survivors, including two children, were being treated at a nearby hospital. The bodies of the dead were being recovered.
Azerbaijan Airlines said the Embraer 190 jet was flying from Baku to Grozny in southern Russia, but had been forced to make an emergency landing around 3 km (1.8 miles) from Aktau in Kazakhstan.
“Preliminary: after a collision with birds, due to an emergency situation on board, its commander decided to ‘go’ to an alternate airfield – Aktau was chosen,” Russia’s aviation watchdog said on Telegram.
But a collision with birds typically results in the plane landing in the nearest available field, said Richard Aboulafia, analyst at consultancy AeroDynamic Advisory. “You can lose control of the plane, but you don’t fly wildly off course as a consequence.”
Kazakhstan’s main transport prosecutor, Timur Suleimenov, told a briefing in the country’s capital Astana that the plane’s black box, which contains flight data to help determine the cause of a crash, had been found, Interfax reported.
RUSSIAN AIRPORT ON FLIGHT PATH WAS SHUT
Aktau is on the opposite shore of the Caspian Sea from Azerbaijan and Russia. Commercial aviation-tracking websites tracked the flight flying north on its scheduled route along the west coast before its flight path was no longer recorded. It then reappeared on the east coast, circling near Aktau airport before crashing into the beach.
Authorities in two Russian regions adjacent to Chechnya, Ingushetia and North Ossetia, reported drone strikes on Wednesday morning.
An official at Makhachkala airport in Russia on the west coast of the Caspian, the airport closest to where the flight disappeared from tracking, told Reuters it had been closed to incoming traffic for several hours on Wednesday morning. Reuters could not immediately reach officials at the airport in Grozny.
Authorities in Kazakhstan said a government commission had been set up to investigate what had happened and its members ordered to fly to the site and ensure that the families of the dead and injured were getting the help they needed.
Kazakhstan would cooperate with Azerbaijan on the investigation, the government said. Azerbaijan Airlines suspended flights from Baku to Russia’s Chechnya region until the investigation is complete, Russia’s state TASS news agency reported, citing the company.
President Vladimir Putin expressed his condolences. Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan, had decided to return home from Russia where he had been due to attend a summit on Wednesday, his office said.
Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed leader of Chechnya, expressed his condolences in a statement and said some of those being treated in hospital were in an extremely serious condition and that he and others would pray for their rapid recovery.
In a statement, Brazilian planemaker Embraer expressed its condolences and said it would support authorities’ efforts.

Title: Railways completes trial run on J&K’s first cable-stayed Anji Khad bridge
Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 06:41:31 +0000
Content: Indian Railways has successfully conducted a trial run of a tower wagon on the Anji Khad Bridge, the country’s first cable-stayed rail bridge, located in Jammu and Kashmir’s Reasi district.
This marks a significant milestone in enhancing railway connectivity in the region, with full services expected to begin by January 2025.
Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw shared a video of the trial on social media, celebrating the progress of the critical project.
“The trial run on the Anji Khad Bridge, a key part of the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Railway link (USBRL) project, has been successfully completed,” the Ministry of Railways confirmed.
Completed last month, the Anji Khad Bridge is a remarkable feat of engineering, featuring a single pylon rising 331 metres above the riverbed.
Supported by 48 cables, the bridge stretches 473.25 metres in length, with a 120-metre viaduct and a 94.25-metre central embankment.
This bridge ranks as India’s second-highest railway bridge after the Chenab Bridge, which holds the world record at 359 metres above the riverbed.
Both structures are part of the ambitious USBRL project aimed at improving connectivity in Jammu and Kashmir.
The USBRL project spans 272 kilometres, with 255 kilometres already completed. The remaining section, between Katra and Reasi, is expected to be finished by the end of this month.
Once completed, the project will reduce travel time between Srinagar and Jammu from six hours to 3.5 hours.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to flag off the Vande Bharat train in January 2025, providing a faster link for passengers traveling between Kashmir and Delhi.
Despite facing natural challenges such as extreme temperatures, earthquake zones, and difficult terrain, the project is nearing completion, bringing much-needed connectivity to the region.

Title: India projected to witness 6.5 per cent real GDP growth in current, next fiscal: report
Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 06:30:40 +0000
Content: India is projected to witness 6.5 per cent real GDP growth in the current and next fiscal (FY25 and FY26), according to a report on Wednesday. This aligns with expectations, given the resilient economy and strong fundamentals.
The latest ‘EY Economy Watch December 2024’ report estimated that by combining the real GDP growth of the first two quarters of FY25, at 6.7 per cent and 5.4 per cent, respectively, with the RBI’s revised growth estimates for the third and fourth quarters of FY25, at 6.8 per cent and 7.2 per cent, respectively, the annual FY25 real GDP growth may be projected at 6.6 per cent.
“However, if the turnaround in GoI’s investment expenditure remains subdued, Q3 growth may be 6.5 per cent or less,” the report stated.
Real GDP growth eased to 5.4 per cent in the July-September quarter (Q2 FY25), compared to 6.7 per cent in the preceding quarter.
The available high-frequency data for October and November presents a mixed picture of the Indian economy’s growth momentum.
Headline manufacturing PMI witnessed a softer expansion of 56.5 in November compared to 57.5 in October. Services PMI, however, remained nearly stable at 58.4 in November 2024, close to its October 2024 level of 58.5, driven by strong international demand and improving business confidence.
As per data released by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association, retail sales of motor vehicles continued to show double-digit growth of 11.2 per cent in November.
Notably, retail sales of two-wheelers and tractors showed robust growth rates of 15.8 per cent and 29.9 per cent, respectively, in November 2024, according to the EY report.
“October 2024 witnessed an increase in IIP growth to 3.5 per cent, up from September’s 3.1 per cent, driven by stronger manufacturing and electricity production,” the report added.
CPI inflation eased to 5.5 per cent in November from 6.2 per cent in October as vegetable prices dropped, while core CPI inflation remained steady at 3.7 per cent for the second consecutive month.
WPI inflation also moderated to 1.9 per cent in November, down from 2.4 per cent in October.
According to DK Srivastava, Chief Policy Advisor at EY India, medium-term real GDP growth prospects for India could remain at 6.5 per cent per year, provided the government accelerates capital expenditure growth in the remaining part of the current fiscal year. He also suggested the need for a medium-term investment pipeline involving the Government of India, state governments, their respective public sector entities, and the private corporate sector.

Title: Telangana CM Revanth Reddy holds meeting with Tollywood actors, filmmakers
Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 06:26:12 +0000
Content: A meeting between Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy and directors, producers, and actors from the Tollywood industry is underway at Telangana State Police Command and Control Centre at Banjara Hills in Hyderabad.
The delegation of influential people from Tollywood is led by Telangana Film Development Corporation (FDC) chairman Dil Raju. Among other attendees are actors like Nagarjuna, Varun Tej, Sai Dharam Tej, Kalyan Ram, Shiva Balaji, Adavi Sesh, Nithin, and Venkatesh.
Directors including Koratala Siva, Anil Ravipudi, K Raghavendra Rao, Prashanth Varma, Sai Rajesh and Producers like Suresh Babu, KL Narayana, Damodhar, Allu Aravind, BVSN Prasad, Chinna Babu among others are present in the meeting.
The meeting is likely to be focused on the smooth functioning of the Tollywood industry.
Meanwhile, on December 4, when Allu Arjun attended the premiere of Pushpa 2: The Rule at Sandhya Theatre, a massive crowd gathered to catch a glimpse of the actor, and chaos ensued when he waved to fans from the sunroof of his car. This led to the tragic death of a woman named Revathi and injuries to her child.
Following the incident, Allu Arjun was arrested and later released on bail after furnishing a Rs 50,000 bond.
On Tuesday, actor Allu Arjun was questioned by Hyderabad police in connection with the tragic incident during the premiere of his film Pushpa 2.
The incident has also sparked political controversy. Telangana Chief Minister Revanth Reddy blamed Allu Arjun for the tragedy, stating in the Assembly that police had denied permission for any event at Sandhya Theatre due to safety concerns.
The actor, however, dismissed the allegations, calling them an attempt at “character assassination.”
Earlier this year, Telangana Minister K Surekha linked former Minister and BRS leader KTR to the divorce of Tollywood actors Samantha and Naga Chaitanya, accusing KTR of tapping the phones of actors and blackmailing them.
Surekha’s remarks sparked massive controversy, with several BRS leaders as well as superstar and Naga Chaitanya’s father, Nagarjuna Akkineni, condemning the remarks.

Title: South Korea’s Constitutional Court to decide impeached president’s fate
Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 06:16:39 +0000
Content: South Korea’s Constitutional Court will hold its first hearing on Friday in the case of President Yoon Suk Yeol, after parliament impeached him over his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3.
Here are key issues for South Korea’s road ahead.
WHAT NEXT?
After being impeached on Dec. 14, Yoon’s presidential powers are suspended but he remains in office, retaining his immunity from most charges except for insurrection or treason. Yoon-appointed Prime Minister Han Duck-soo is acting president.
The Constitutional Court must decide within 180 days whether to remove Yoon from office or reject the impeachment and restore his powers. If the court removes Yoon or he resigns, a presidential election must be held within 60 days.
The court is due to hold its first preparatory hearing on Friday.
Opposition Democratic Party lawmaker Jung Chung-rae, the head of parliament’s Legislation and Judiciary Committee, is leading the case for removing Yoon.
Yoon’s legal counsel has not yet been announced, but his background as a prosecutor has sparked reports that he is turning to former colleagues or could even represent himself.
Kim Hong-il, a former prosecutor and former head of the broadcasting regulator under Yoon, as well as former Constitutional Court spokesperson Bae Bo-yoon, are expected to join Yoon’s legal teams in the impeachment review and in criminal investigations, local media has reported.
IMPEDIMENTS TO A COURT RULING?
Under South Korea’s constitution, six justices must agree in order to oust an impeached president. The nine-member Constitutional Court now has three vacancies, so the current justices would have to vote unanimously to remove Yoon.
The Constitutional Court has said that it can deliberate and hear arguments with just six justices.
The three vacancies are allotted for parliament to fill. The main opposition Democratic Party, which has a majority in parliament, is seeking to fill the vacancies.
Parliament held hearings for all three potential nominees this week, which the ruling People Power Party boycotted, saying that acting president Han does not have the right to appoint Constitutional Court justices.
There is precedent for an acting president appointing a Constitutional Court justice, as occurred when former President Park Geun-hye was impeached in 2016-2017.
WHAT HAPPENS IN COURT?
In South Korea’s only previous presidential removal by impeachment, the court took three months to oust Park in 2017.
This time, the terms of two court justices expire in April, and legal experts predict the court may seek to rule before then to minimise uncertainty.
In the past, academics say, Constitutional Court justices have not voted predictably by political leaning but have decided case by case, based on their interpretation of the constitution.
Conservative attempts to rally popular support for Yoon are not expected to affect the court’s ruling, as Park was removed from office despite continued conservative rallies to keep her in power, warring with candlelight rallies to remove her from power.
In the case of Park, who like Yoon was from a centre-right party, the court voted unanimously to remove her, including some justices viewed as conservative and two Park appointees.
Yoon also faces criminal investigations related to the martial law decision.
If charged, he could ask the Constitutional Court to suspend the 180-day clock on the impeachment ruling. The court denied a similar request in Park’s case.
In 2004, then-President Roh Moo-hyun, from a centre-left party, was impeached on the charge of failing to maintain political neutrality as required of a high public official.
The court rejected the motion after about two months, and Roh fulfilled his five-year term.

Title: Indian Rupee to remain in pressure amid weak manufacturing exports; policy rate differential with US: report
Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 06:04:18 +0000
Content: The Indian rupee (INR) is expected to come under pressure in 2025 due to a combination of global and domestic challenges, according to a report by Standard Chartered Bank.
Key factors identified in the report include slowing foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, weak manufacturing export growth amid declining global demand, and a narrowing policy rate differential with the United States. These elements are likely to exert downward pressure on the Indian currency.
The report projects the rupee to exhibit a modest depreciating trend, potentially reaching ₹85.5 per US dollar over the next 12 months. While India’s improving economic growth, attractive real yields, and strong foreign exchange reserves offer some support to the currency, these positive factors may not be enough to counteract the broader pressures.
“We expect the INR to trade with a modest depreciating bias to 85.5/USD over a 12-month time horizon,” the report said.
On a positive note, the report highlighted India’s favorable macroeconomic outlook, projecting a recovery in economic growth from the current cyclical slowdown. Key drivers of this recovery include increased government capital expenditure, a resurgence in rural demand, improved urban consumption, and broader policy support measures.
Additionally, inflation is expected to trend lower, aided by better sowing of summer and winter crops, government measures to manage supply concerns, and the disinflationary effects of past monetary policy tightening.
The report also underscored positive prospects for Indian equities, attributing potential gains to robust GDP growth and corporate earnings, which are expected to outpace those of major global peers. Steady inflows from domestic investors through systematic investment plans (SIPs) and renewed foreign investments—driven by strong macroeconomic fundamentals, expected rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve, and low foreign investor positioning—are projected to provide strong support for the stock market.
“India’s economic growth is expected to recover from a cyclical slowdown and stay ahead of its major peers in 2025,” the report added.
Despite challenges for the rupee, Standard Chartered Bank’s analysis pointed to India’s resilience, noting its strong macroeconomic fundamentals and growth potential as critical factors shaping its economic outlook for the coming year.

Title: India fights back with quick wickets on day 1 of crucial fourth test at MCG as Steve Smith holds firm for Australia
Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 06:02:07 +0000
Content: The highly anticipated fourth Test between Australia and India began at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Thursday, coinciding with the traditional match that commences on December 26th each year.
This match holds great significance for both teams, as a victory would greatly improve their chances of qualifying for the Final, scheduled to be held at Lord’s from 11th to 15th June 2025.
Winning the toss, Australian captain Pat Cummins elected to bat first. Australia made a cautious start against India’s formidable pace attack, led by Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj.
Openers Sam Konstas and Usman Khawaja provided a solid platform, compiling a steady 89-run partnership. However, the breakthrough came when Ravindra Jadeja trapped Konstas LBW, dismissing him for a well-played knock.
Usman Khawaja continued to anchor the innings, forging a crucial 65-run stand with Marnus Labuschagne. Khawaja eventually fell to Bumrah after making a patient 57, allowing India a glimmer of hope.
After drinks before the tea session, off-spinner Washington Sundar provided India with a much-needed breakthrough by taking the wicket of Labuschagne.
He made a valuable 72 runs, thus ending the dangerous 183-run partnership between him and the veteran Steve Smith.
Jasprit Bumrah then took two quick wickets, dismissing Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh, who made 4 and 0 runs, respectively. These three quick wickets have brought India back into the match.
The only hurdle for India now is Steve Smith, who remains not out on 48 runs, holding the fort for Australia along with Alex Carey.
The Indian bowlers would like to wrap up the Australian innings as soon as possible to put pressure on the hosts.
Earlier, India’s bowlers struggled to break this key stand, which has been pivotal to Australia’s innings.
From India’s perspective, this Test is a must-win to stay in contention for the final at Lord’s.
Currently sitting third in the standings, any loss in this or the upcoming fifth and final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground would likely eliminate their chances of qualifying for the final.
In terms of team selection, Rohit Sharma is back as the opener for India after experimenting with a middle-order role in the second and third Tests.
His return to the top order will strengthen India’s batting lineup, but the pressure remains on India’s bowlers to dismantle the strong Australian partnership.

Title: Syrian police killed in ambush as unrest spreads
Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 05:27:49 +0000
Content: Fourteen members of the Syrian police were killed in an “ambush” by forces loyal to the ousted government in the Tartous countryside, the transitional administration said early on Thursday, as demonstrations and an overnight curfew elsewhere marked the most widespread unrest since Bashar al-Assad’s removal more than two weeks ago.
Syria’s new interior minister said on Telegram that 10 police members were also wounded by what he called “remnants” of the Assad government in Tartous, vowing to crack down on “anyone who dares to undermine Syria’s security or endanger the lives of its citizens.”
Earlier, Syrian police imposed an overnight curfew in the city of Homs, state media reported, after unrest there linked to demonstrations that residents said were led by members of the minority Alawite and Shi’ite Muslim religious communities.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the demands of the demonstrators nor the degree of disturbance that took place.
Some residents said the demonstrations were linked to pressure and violence in recent days aimed at members of the Alawite minority, a sect long seen as loyal to Assad, who was toppled by Sunni Islamist rebels on Dec. 8.
Spokespeople for Syria’s new ruling administration led by the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group, a former al Qaeda affiliate, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the curfew.
State media said the curfew was being imposed for one night, from 6 pm local time (1500 GMT) until 8 am on Thursday morning.
The country’s new leaders have repeatedly vowed to protect minority religious groups, who fear the former rebels now in control could seek to impose a conservative form of Islamist government.
Small demonstrations also took place in other areas on or near Syria’s coast, where most of the country’s Alawite minority live, including in Tartous.
The demonstrations took place around the time an undated video was circulated on social networks showing a fire inside an Alawite shrine in the city of Aleppo, with armed men walking around inside and posing near human bodies.
The interior ministry said on its official Telegram account the video dated back to the rebel offensive on Aleppo in late November and the violence was carried out by unknown groups, adding whoever was circulating the video now appeared to be seeking to incite sectarian strife.
The ministry also said some members of the former regime had attacked interior ministry forces in Syria’s coastal area on Wednesday, leaving a number of dead and wounded.

Title: India a global leader in disaster warning systems: Jitendra Singh
Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 13:19:29 +0000
Content: India has emerged as a global leader in “disaster warning” and is catering to other nations as well across the world, said Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science and Technology Dr. Jitendra Singh on Thursday.
He said this while commemorating the 20th anniversary of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami at INCOIS (Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services).
“India’s emergence as a global leader in providing world-class disaster warning systems, underscores the pivotal role of scientific advancements in fostering safety and sustainability,” said the minister.
The Minister recalled that the INCOIS was conceptualised following the tragic Tsunami of 2004, which claimed over 230,000 lives worldwide, including 10,749 in India.
He noted that after 2014, the INCOIS made rapid strides to be recognised as the world’s most state-of-the-art institute of its kind.
India’s Tsunami Early Warning System, lauded internationally, was showcased as a cornerstone of the nation’s disaster preparedness.
He said that INCOIS played an active role in the Ocean Decade Tsunami Programme — aiming to achieve 100 per cent tsunami-ready communities globally by 2030.
Singh states that these initiatives can strengthen global partnerships as well as “pave the way for resilient coastal communities worldwide”.
Further, to bolster community resilience across vulnerable regions, collaborations are ongoing with UNESCO and the Tsunami Ready Initiative, the Minister informed.
In addition to the tsunami, the Minister underscored the need to integrate warnings with storm surges and high waves into a comprehensive multi-hazard early warning system.
“This forward-looking approach will ensure that we continue to safeguard lives and livelihoods against a wide spectrum of potential disasters,” he added.
Singh also underlined the growing significance of oceanic exploration in India’s journey toward becoming “Viksit Bharat”.
With a 7,500-kilometre coastline and abundant marine resources, he advocated for their sustainable exploration and conservation.
“Our deep-sea mission and initiatives like BioE3 [Biotechnology for Environment, Employment, and Economy] are creating an ecosystem that will not only enhance biodiversity but also contribute to national prosperity,” the Minister said.
“We are planning to deploy an Indian in the deep sea and another in space, possibly by 2026, marking a historic milestone,” he added.

Title: Pakistan military court sentences 60 civilians up to 10 years in prison
Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 11:32:49 +0000
Content: A Pakistani military court sentenced sixty civilians to jail time ranging from 2 to 10 years in connection with attacks on military facilities following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan in 2023, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
Those sentenced include a relative of Khan as well as two retired military officers. Days earlier, 25 others were sentenced on the same charges.
Khan’s arrest in May 2023 sparked countrywide protests that saw his supporters attack and ransack military installations in an unprecedented backlash against Pakistan’s powerful army generals.
The military’s media wing said, “The Nation, Government, and the Armed Forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained.”
The sentences have sparked concerns among Khan’s supporters that military courts will play a more significant role in cases related to the former leader, who is facing multiple charges, including inciting attacks against the armed forces.
The international community has also expressed concerns over the sentencing. The United States stated it is “deeply concerned” about the sentences, while the United Kingdom’s foreign office noted that trying civilians in military courts “lacks transparency, independent scrutiny and undermines the right to a fair trial”.
The European Union also criticized the sentences, saying they are “inconsistent with the obligations that Pakistan has undertaken under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights”.
In a press conference on Wednesday, the information minister said the military court sentences do not infringe upon the right to a fair trial, as individuals are granted access to a lawyer, family, and still have the opportunity to appeal twice, both within the military court and civilian court, the relevant high court.
Khan’s supporters have denied any wrongdoing, and Khan himself claims that the cases against him are politically motivated.
The military and government have denied any unfair treatment of Khan or his supporters.

Title: Advertising, marketing sector to see steady 9% hiring intent: report
Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 11:15:29 +0000
Content: The marketing and advertising sector is expected to witness a steady 9% hiring intent, according to a report released on Thursday.
The report by TeamLease EdTech attributes this growth to a surge in digital advertising, the expansion of content marketing, and the adoption of data-driven marketing strategies.
The rise of e-commerce and digital platforms, which demand targeted advertising, is driving significant transformation in the sector.
The digital revolution has particularly impacted key industries, including FMCG, e-commerce, automotive, consumer durables, real estate, and tourism, which now account for the largest share of advertising spend.
Across these industries, companies are focusing on brand engagement through meaningful content and leveraging analytics to deliver personalized consumer experiences. Additionally, businesses are substantially increasing their digital marketing budgets to capitalize on the superior targeting capabilities of cost-effective digital platforms.
“We are living in a digital-first world where students aggressively investing in emerging marketing skills will unlock unprecedented career opportunities,” said Jaideep Kewalramani, COO and Head of Employability Business, TeamLease EdTech.
“With digital platforms reshaping consumer interactions, freshers equipped with marketing analytics, content creation, and technological insights are becoming the new catalysts for brand success,” he added.
The report further highlights high-demand roles such as SEO executives, who manage web visibility strategies; market research assistants, responsible for gathering consumer data and analyzing market trends; and social media specialists, who create engaging content and manage brand interactions.
Mumbai and Bangalore emerged as key hiring hubs, with Gurugram and Pune also showing moderate growth in hiring intent.
Freshers looking to enter the sector must develop a comprehensive skill set. Technical expertise in areas such as SEO, social media management, and content creation is crucial, complemented by core competencies in marketing analytics, keyword research, and trend analysis. Additionally, soft skills such as creativity, adaptability, communication, and collaboration are equally important, the report noted.

On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), 1,639 shares advanced, while 2,329 declined, with 106 shares remaining unchanged.
Market Overview and Sectoral Performance
Market experts attributed the flat performance to the expiry of futures and options (F&O) contracts, as well as the absence of significant domestic or global cues, with many international markets on holiday.
Gains were seen in the auto sector following recent corrections, while other sectors like PSU banks, financial services, pharma, realty, and energy also witnessed buying activity.
Among the top gainers in the Sensex pack were Adani Ports, M&M, Maruti Suzuki, Sun Pharma, Bharti Airtel, Tata Motors, Kotak Mahindra Bank, UltraTech Cement, Power Grid, HCL Tech, SBI, and Tata Steel. On the losing side, Titan, Asian Paints, Zomato, Tech Mahindra, Nestle India, and Reliance recorded declines.
Expert Insights
“Concerns over foreign institutional investor (FII) outflows, the depreciating rupee, and the strengthening US dollar index are keeping the market cautious. There are also ongoing worries about potential tariffs and the lack of clarity on rate cuts in 2025,” an expert commented.
On December 24, FIIs sold equities worth Rs. 2,454.21 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) purchased equities amounting to Rs. 2,819.25 crore.

Title: Russia’s security must be guaranteed by any Ukraine peace deal, Lavrov says
Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 10:49:04 +0000
Content: Russia sees no point in a weak ceasefire to freeze the war in Ukraine but Moscow wants a legally binding deal for a lasting peace that would ensure the security of both Russia and its neighbours, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday.
“A truce is a path to nowhere,” Lavrov said, adding that Moscow suspected such a weak truce would be simply used by the West to re-arm Ukraine.
“We need final legal agreements that will fix all the conditions for ensuring the security of the Russian Federation and, of course, the legitimate security interests of our neighbors,” Lavrov said.
He added that Moscow wanted the legal documents drafted in such a way to ensure “the impossibility of violating these agreements.”
Reuters reported last month that President Vladimir Putin is open to discussing a Ukraine ceasefire deal with Donald Trump but rules out making any major territorial concessions and insists Kyiv abandon ambitions to join NATO.
Putin said last week that he was ready to compromise over Ukraine in possible talks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on ending the war and had no conditions for starting talks with the Ukrainian authorities.
Putin said the fighting was complex, so it was “difficult and pointless to guess what lies ahead… (but) we are moving, as you said, towards solving our primary tasks, which we outlined at the beginning of the special military operation.”
Trump, who has repeatedly said he will end the war, said on Sunday that Putin wanted to meet with him. Russia says there have been no contacts with the incoming Trump administration.
Trump’s Ukraine envoy, Retired Lieutenant-General Keith Kellogg, will travel to Kyiv and several other European capitals in early January as the next administration tries to bring a swift end to the Russia-Ukraine war, according to two sources with knowledge of the trip’s planning.
“I really hope that the administration of Mr. Trump, including Mr. Kellogg, will get involved in the root causes of the conflict. We are always ready for consultations,” Lavrov said.
Putin says an arrogant West led by the United States ignored Russia’s post-Soviet interests, tried to pull Ukraine into its orbit since 2014 and then used Ukraine to fight a proxy war aimed at weakening – and ultimately destroying – Russia.
After a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine’s 2014 Maidan Revolution, Russia annexed Crimea and began giving military support to pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine.
The West says Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine was an imperial-style land grab by Moscow that has strengthened the NATO military alliance and weakened Russia.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that Ukraine’s membership of NATO is “achievable”, but that Kyiv will have to fight to persuade allies to make it happen.
Moscow says the prospect of Ukraine joining NATO was one of the principal justifications for its invasion. Russia has said it any NATO membership for Ukraine would make any peace deal impossible.

Content: The Department of Consumer Affairs, Government of India, has released its year-end review, spotlighting significant initiatives and accomplishments in 2024 aimed at stabilizing prices, enhancing consumer welfare, and leveraging technology for improved services.
Price Monitoring and Stabilization
The Price Monitoring Division (PMD) of the Department played a crucial role in controlling the prices of essential commodities like onions, tomatoes, and pulses.
Through daily price tracking and the strategic use of buffer stocks, the government managed price volatility.
The Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF), with a budget allocation of Rs.10,000 crore for 2024-25, enabled timely market interventions, including the sale of Bharat Dal at affordable prices.
Launch of Bharat Dal
The government introduced Bharat Dal in 2024, selling Chana, Moong, and Masur dal through retail outlets such as NAFED, Kendriya Bhandar, and online platforms.
Priced competitively, Bharat Dal was aimed at making pulses affordable for the common man, with Chana Dal available at Rs. 70 per kg.
Consumer Protection and Legal Metrology
The department saw the implementation of important legal measures under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019. This included the launch of 570 Mediation Cells across the country to speed up consumer dispute resolutions.
Additionally, the “E-Daakhil” portal was expanded nationwide, enabling consumers to file complaints online.
Legal Metrology services were enhanced with the creation of a National Legal Metrology Portal for streamlined approvals, licensing, and enforcement activities.
The department also implemented new rules, mandating the declaration of the unit sale price and country of origin for goods sold online, increasing transparency for consumers.
National Consumer Helpline Expansion
The National Consumer Helpline (NCH) saw a tenfold increase in the number of calls, reflecting growing consumer confidence.
Offering services in 17 languages, the helpline introduced AI-based speech recognition and a multilingual chatbot under the NCH 2.0 initiative to assist consumers more efficiently.
National Test House (NTH) Expansion
The National Test House (NTH) made significant strides in testing and certification services, establishing advanced testing facilities for electric vehicle (EV) batteries and expanding fertilizer testing capabilities.
The department also worked on setting up a comprehensive solar panel testing laboratory and introduced drone certification services.
Boosting Consumer Welfare
The Consumer Welfare Fund continued to support initiatives across states, with over ₹32 crore allocated in 2024-25. Twenty-four states and one union territory now have established Consumer Welfare Corpus Funds, aimed at protecting and promoting consumer rights.
Technological Advancements
BIS, the Bureau of Indian Standards, reported significant progress in modernizing its laboratories.
The integration of the Laboratory Information Management Software (LIMS) has enhanced transparency and efficiency in product testing.
In 2024, BIS granted 6,451 new product licenses, including 77 new product categories, further boosting consumer trust.

Title: India’s share in global trade doubled since 2005, comparatively moderated in last 10 years: report
Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 10:11:47 +0000
Content: India has doubled its contribution to global trade over the last two decades, marking a significant rise in its share of global exports and imports, according to a report by the National Stock Exchange (NSE). However, the pace of growth has moderated in the past decade due to global economic challenges.
The report reveals that India’s share in global merchandise exports increased from 0.9 percent in 2005 to 1.8 percent in 2023, while its share in services exports more than doubled from 2 percent to 4.3 percent. Overall, the country’s export share rose from 1.2 percent in 2005 to 2.4 percent in 2023, driven by factors like improved trade agreements, government initiatives such as Make in India, the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme, and diversification of export portfolios.
In services exports, India ranks seventh globally, a testament to its strong performance in this sector, which accounts for 43.8 percent of India’s total exports—significantly higher than the global average of 24.7 percent. This dominance reflects India’s comparative advantage in IT, financial, and consulting services.
India’s import share has also seen substantial growth. The report notes that merchandise imports increased from 1.3 percent in 2005 to 2.8 percent in 2023, while services imports grew from 2.4 percent to 3.4 percent. Collectively, India’s share in global imports rose from 1.5 percent to 2.9 percent over the same period.
India’s export growth was particularly robust in the first two decades following economic liberalization, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.1 percent between FY94 and FY04, and 17.3 percent from FY04 to FY14. However, the last decade (FY14-FY24) witnessed a slowdown, with export growth declining to a CAGR of 3.3 percent due to subdued global demand, rising trade protectionism, and disruptions like the COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical tensions.
Despite the slowdown, services exports demonstrated resilience, maintaining a higher CAGR of 8.4 percent during the last decade, reflecting India’s competitive edge in the global services sector.
The report also highlights India’s Relative Comparative Advantage (RCA) in sectors like agriculture, textiles, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, while identifying gaps in machinery, transport equipment, and electronics—areas with potential for future development.
The analysis sheds light on global trade dynamics over the past two decades. While India made significant gains, China’s share in global merchandise exports surged, largely at the expense of traditional export leaders like Japan, Germany, France, the UK, and the USA. In the services sector, India and Singapore expanded their shares, while the USA saw a decline.

Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 10:03:46 +0000
Content: The government’s new ordinance on cooperatives, which includes rules for regulating cooperatives and returning the savings of members, will be sent to the President today. In a decision taken by council of Ministers in Singhdurbar in Nepal, it was decided to scrap the National Cooperative Development Board and recommend for introducing an ordinance to regulate cooperative institutions to the President.
The ordinance comes in response to suggestions from a parliamentary committee investigating cooperatives. It sets criteria for returning savings of up to Rs 500,000 deposited in cooperatives.
The ordinance also creates a National Cooperative Regulatory Authority, which will be independent and self-governing. The authority will follow guidelines set by the Nepal Rastra Bank.
Savings and credit cooperatives are now categorised into three levels, and registration will be done at the local level. The ordinance also sets limits on individual savings and loans: Rs 1 million for cooperatives within a district, Rs 2.5 million for cooperatives within a province, and Rs 5 million for those operating nationwide.
Spokesperson of Nepal government and Minister for Communication and Information Technology Prithvi Subba Gurung, clarified that investigations would be conducted against everyone involved in cooperative fraud cases, regardless of their political affiliation. The ordinance includes provisions regarding the chairperson, secretary, and other members of the commission. Once the President issues the ordinance and it is published in the national gazette, it will come into effect. It also needs to be endorsed by the upcoming winter session of the Federal Parliament.

Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 09:45:34 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday emphasized the bravery and sacrifices made by the Sahibzades, the sons of Guru Gobind Singh, during his address at an event marking the third annual ‘Veer Baal Diwas’ at Bharat Mandapam in the national capital. The Prime Minister hailed their courage as foundational to the strength of India’s democracy today.
“Sahibzades’ courage and sacrifice are the pillars behind India’s strong democracy that India is proud of today,” PM Modi remarked, highlighting the significance of the day. He explained that the government introduced Veer Baal Diwas to honor the valour and sacrifices of the Sahibzades, adding that the day serves as a reminder of their unwavering commitment to the nation.
During the event, PM Modi also congratulated the 2024 recipients of the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar, recognizing 17 children for their exceptional achievements across various fields including bravery, innovation, science and technology, sports, and the arts. “They have shown how capable the youth and children of India are,” he said, offering his congratulations to the awardees and their families.
Reflecting on the lives of Sahibzadas Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh, the Prime Minister remembered their heroic stand against the Mughal Empire. “Though young, Sahibzada Zorawar Singh and Sahibzada Fateh Singh’s courage was unmatched. They faced immense suffering but stood firm for their principles, defying the Mughal Empire. Their sacrifices remind us that no matter the hardships, nothing is more important than the nation and its interests,” he added.
PM Modi also stressed that every act of service to the country, regardless of its scale, embodies bravery. “Every child and young man living for his country is a ‘Veer Balak’,” he said, underscoring the significance of the day in fostering national pride. He further noted that this year’s celebration holds special meaning as it marks the 75th anniversary of the formation of India’s constitution, with the youth playing an instrumental role in the country’s progress.
“From startups to science, from sports to entrepreneurship, India’s youth are driving revolutions across every sector,” he remarked, praising their contributions to India’s growth.
Earlier in the day, PM Modi interacted with the recipients of the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar ahead of the ceremony at Rashtrapati Bhavan Cultural Centre, where President Droupadi Murmu conferred the awards on the 17 young achievers.
The government declared December 26 as Veer Baal Diwas in January 2022 to commemorate the courage and sacrifice of Guru Gobind Singh’s sons, who sacrificed their lives in the pursuit of justice.
This annual observance serves as a tribute to the enduring legacy of the Sahibzades and aims to inspire the youth of India to follow their example of dedication and patriotism.

Title: Dr. Manmohan Singh: The visionary leader who transformed the nation’s economy
Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 19:46:17 +0000
Content: Former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, widely regarded as the architect of India’s economic liberalisation, passed away on Thursday at the age of 92. Singh’s legacy as a visionary leader and economist has left an enduring impact on India’s political and economic landscape.
Early Life and Education
Born on September 26, 1932, in Gah, now in Pakistan, Singh pursued economics at Punjab University, where he earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees. In 1957, he completed an Economics Tripos at Cambridge University and later received a DPhil in Economics from Oxford University in 1962. Singh was a professor at Punjab University and Delhi School of Economics before becoming Economic Advisor in the Ministry of Foreign Trade in 1971. He later served as Chief Economic Advisor in the Finance Ministry from 1972 to 1976.
Role at the Reserve Bank of India
Singh served as the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India from September 1982 to January 1985. During his tenure, Singh was also a member-secretary of the Planning Commission from 1980 to 1982 and its deputy chairman from 1985 to 1987.
Singh also served as Secretary-General of the South Commission in Geneva from 1987 to 1990. He held positions such as Advisor to the Prime Minister and Chairman of the University Grants Commission.
A Trailblazing Finance Minister
Appointed Finance Minister in 1991 under Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, Singh steered India through one of its most severe economic crises. Amid a balance-of-payments crisis, Singh introduced sweeping reforms such as rupee devaluation, tax restructuring, and the removal of trade barriers. These measures unlocked foreign investments and laid the foundation for India’s rapid economic growth.
The reforms marked a turning point, opening India’s economy to the global market and transitioning the country into an era of economic dynamism. Singh’s tenure as Finance Minister was celebrated for breaking new ground and stabilising India’s fiscal health.
Parliamentary Career
Singh was elected to the Rajya Sabha from Assam in 1991 and served as an MP until 2004. From 1998 to 2004, Singh served as the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha.
Following Congress’ victory in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, Singh became the first Sikh Prime Minister of India. He served two consecutive terms, taking the oath of office on May 22, 2004, and May 22, 2009.
Re-elected in 2009, his second term was marred by challenges such as inflation, corruption scandals, and administrative inefficiencies. Despite these hurdles, his government introduced landmark policies, including legislation guaranteeing citizens access to food, education, employment, and information. His tenure also consolidated India’s position as a global economic power.
Awards and Recognitions
Singh was honored with several awards during his career, including the Padma Vibhushan in 1987, the Euro Money Award for Finance Minister in 1993, the Asia Money Award for Finance Minister in 1993 and 1994, and the Jawaharlal Nehru Birth Centenary Award by the Indian Science Congress in 1995.

Title: India a global leader in disaster warning systems: Jitendra Singh
Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 13:19:29 +0000
Content: India has emerged as a global leader in “disaster warning” and is catering to other nations as well across the world, said Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science and Technology Dr. Jitendra Singh on Thursday.
He said this while commemorating the 20th anniversary of the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami at INCOIS (Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services).
“India’s emergence as a global leader in providing world-class disaster warning systems, underscores the pivotal role of scientific advancements in fostering safety and sustainability,” said the minister.
The Minister recalled that the INCOIS was conceptualised following the tragic Tsunami of 2004, which claimed over 230,000 lives worldwide, including 10,749 in India.
He noted that after 2014, the INCOIS made rapid strides to be recognised as the world’s most state-of-the-art institute of its kind.
India’s Tsunami Early Warning System, lauded internationally, was showcased as a cornerstone of the nation’s disaster preparedness.
He said that INCOIS played an active role in the Ocean Decade Tsunami Programme — aiming to achieve 100 per cent tsunami-ready communities globally by 2030.
Singh states that these initiatives can strengthen global partnerships as well as “pave the way for resilient coastal communities worldwide”.
Further, to bolster community resilience across vulnerable regions, collaborations are ongoing with UNESCO and the Tsunami Ready Initiative, the Minister informed.
In addition to the tsunami, the Minister underscored the need to integrate warnings with storm surges and high waves into a comprehensive multi-hazard early warning system.
“This forward-looking approach will ensure that we continue to safeguard lives and livelihoods against a wide spectrum of potential disasters,” he added.
Singh also underlined the growing significance of oceanic exploration in India’s journey toward becoming “Viksit Bharat”.
With a 7,500-kilometre coastline and abundant marine resources, he advocated for their sustainable exploration and conservation.
“Our deep-sea mission and initiatives like BioE3 [Biotechnology for Environment, Employment, and Economy] are creating an ecosystem that will not only enhance biodiversity but also contribute to national prosperity,” the Minister said.
“We are planning to deploy an Indian in the deep sea and another in space, possibly by 2026, marking a historic milestone,” he added.

Title: Pakistan military court sentences 60 civilians up to 10 years in prison
Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 11:32:49 +0000
Content: A Pakistani military court sentenced sixty civilians to jail time ranging from 2 to 10 years in connection with attacks on military facilities following the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan in 2023, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.
Those sentenced include a relative of Khan as well as two retired military officers. Days earlier, 25 others were sentenced on the same charges.
Khan’s arrest in May 2023 sparked countrywide protests that saw his supporters attack and ransack military installations in an unprecedented backlash against Pakistan’s powerful army generals.
The military’s media wing said, “The Nation, Government, and the Armed Forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained.”
The sentences have sparked concerns among Khan’s supporters that military courts will play a more significant role in cases related to the former leader, who is facing multiple charges, including inciting attacks against the armed forces.
The international community has also expressed concerns over the sentencing. The United States stated it is “deeply concerned” about the sentences, while the United Kingdom’s foreign office noted that trying civilians in military courts “lacks transparency, independent scrutiny and undermines the right to a fair trial”.
The European Union also criticized the sentences, saying they are “inconsistent with the obligations that Pakistan has undertaken under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights”.
In a press conference on Wednesday, the information minister said the military court sentences do not infringe upon the right to a fair trial, as individuals are granted access to a lawyer, family, and still have the opportunity to appeal twice, both within the military court and civilian court, the relevant high court.
Khan’s supporters have denied any wrongdoing, and Khan himself claims that the cases against him are politically motivated.
The military and government have denied any unfair treatment of Khan or his supporters.

Title: Advertising, marketing sector to see steady 9% hiring intent: report
Publication Date: Thu, 26 Dec 2024 11:15:29 +0000
Content: The marketing and advertising sector is expected to witness a steady 9% hiring intent, according to a report released on Thursday.
The report by TeamLease EdTech attributes this growth to a surge in digital advertising, the expansion of content marketing, and the adoption of data-driven marketing strategies.
The rise of e-commerce and digital platforms, which demand targeted advertising, is driving significant transformation in the sector.
The digital revolution has particularly impacted key industries, including FMCG, e-commerce, automotive, consumer durables, real estate, and tourism, which now account for the largest share of advertising spend.
Across these industries, companies are focusing on brand engagement through meaningful content and leveraging analytics to deliver personalized consumer experiences. Additionally, businesses are substantially increasing their digital marketing budgets to capitalize on the superior targeting capabilities of cost-effective digital platforms.
“We are living in a digital-first world where students aggressively investing in emerging marketing skills will unlock unprecedented career opportunities,” said Jaideep Kewalramani, COO and Head of Employability Business, TeamLease EdTech.
“With digital platforms reshaping consumer interactions, freshers equipped with marketing analytics, content creation, and technological insights are becoming the new catalysts for brand success,” he added.
The report further highlights high-demand roles such as SEO executives, who manage web visibility strategies; market research assistants, responsible for gathering consumer data and analyzing market trends; and social media specialists, who create engaging content and manage brand interactions.
Mumbai and Bangalore emerged as key hiring hubs, with Gurugram and Pune also showing moderate growth in hiring intent.
Freshers looking to enter the sector must develop a comprehensive skill set. Technical expertise in areas such as SEO, social media management, and content creation is crucial, complemented by core competencies in marketing analytics, keyword research, and trend analysis. Additionally, soft skills such as creativity, adaptability, communication, and collaboration are equally important, the report noted.

Title: “India, China achieved consensus to restore ground situation in certain areas along LAC,” MoD year end review
Publication Date: Fri, 27 Dec 2024 05:49:28 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has announced that India and China have achieved a broad consensus to restore the ground situation in specific areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). The statement, part of the ministry’s year-end review, highlighted ongoing efforts at diplomatic and military levels to address border tensions and ensure stability.
“India and China achieved a broad consensus to restore the ground situation in certain areas along the LAC. Talks at diplomatic and military levels have paved the way for resolving differences in these regions, with agreements grounded in the principles of equal and mutual security,” the MoD said.
Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, during the Chanakya Defence Dialogue on October 24, emphasized the importance of continuous dialogue in achieving solutions, describing the consensus as a testament to constructive engagement.
The review underscored the Indian Army’s high level of operational readiness, crucial for maintaining stability and dominance along all frontiers, including the LAC and the Line of Control (LoC). “The Indian Army maintained a high state of operational preparedness, carrying out relentless counter-terrorist operations and bolstering border infrastructure in line with the government’s ‘Viksit Bharat Vision,'” the statement added.
The MoD acknowledged the stable yet sensitive situation along the LAC, citing progress made in disengagement and troop relocation from friction points such as Depsang and Demchok. “Following prolonged negotiations at diplomatic and military levels, a consensus was reached on October 21. This includes disengagement, troop relocation, joint verification, and the resumption of patrolling in traditional areas,” the ministry reported.
While the LoC remains peaceful following the February 2021 DGsMO agreement, the security situation in Jammu and Kashmir continues to improve despite occasional violence. The MoD reaffirmed the Indian Army’s vigilance and preparedness to respond to any escalation.
The statement also referenced a recent development from the 23rd Meeting of Special Representatives of India and China, held on December 18 in Beijing. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to a “fair, reasonable, and mutually acceptable framework” for resolving boundary issues based on the 2005 political parameters and guiding principles.
Tensions along the LAC escalated in April-May 2020 when China enhanced its troop and armament deployment in the Western Sector and attempted multiple transgressions.

Title: Delhi residents wake up to light rain, reduced visibility
Publication Date: Fri, 27 Dec 2024 04:02:22 +0000
Content: Light rain lashed several parts of the national capital on Friday morning, as a layer of fog covered the city, resulting in reduced visibility.
As per the India Meteorological Department, the lowest recorded temperature on Friday is 12 degrees Celsius, while the maximum temperature is 20 degrees Celsius.
The IMD has predicted a “thunderstorm with rain” for Delhi on Friday and Saturday. With this, more showers are expected to drizzle over the city.
A local resident, Deepak Pandey, said, “The weather has become good, and it feels like Kashmir. The weather has become so pleasant, and one could travel in it. It is cold, but the rain has decreased the level of pollution.”
A tourist from Madhya Pradesh, Raman Kushwaha, said, “It is cold. Light rain has occurred, but it’s good to visit places in this weather. Pollution has also decreased.”
Visuals from Kartavya Path showed the drizzle bringing pleasant weather along with dense fog in the area.
Meanwhile, the air quality index in the city remained in the ‘very poor’ category with an AQI of 371, as of 7 am, according to the data of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).
As of 7 am, the AQI measured at Anand Vihar is 398, IGI Airport (T3) is 340, Aya Nagar is 360, Lodhi Road is 345, ITO is 380, Chandani Chowk is 315, and Punjabi Bagh is 386.
The central government’s air quality monitoring panel on Tuesday revoked Stage IV (‘Severe+’) measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) following an improvement in air quality.
However, actions under Stages I, II, and III will remain in force to prevent any further deterioration of air quality, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) announced on December 24.
The decision came after Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) improved on December 24.
The improvement in air quality was attributed to favorable meteorological conditions, including improved wind speed, according to forecasts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM).
In line with the Supreme Court’s directives, Stage IV measures were initially invoked when AQI levels breached the 400 mark on December 16.
The measures were aimed at curbing severe pollution levels and included restrictions on industrial activities, construction, and the entry of nonessential trucks into Delhi.
The Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) is a set of emergency measures implemented in Delhi-NCR to tackle air pollution based on the severity of the Air Quality Index (AQI).

Title: At least 69 migrants killed in shipwreck off Morocco on deadly route to Spain
Publication Date: Fri, 27 Dec 2024 12:39:39 +0000
Content: At least 69 people died after a boat headed from West Africa to the Canary Islands capsized off Morocco on Dec. 19, Malian authorities said, as data showed deaths of migrants attempting to reach Spain surged to an all-time high in 2024.
The makeshift boat was carrying around 80 people when it capsized. Only 11 survived, the Ministry of Malians Abroad said in a statement on Thursday, after collecting information to reconstruct the incident.
A crisis unit has been set up to monitor the situation, it added.
The Atlantic migration route from the coast of West Africa to Spain’s Canary Islands, typically used by African migrants trying to reach mainland Spain, has seen a surge this year, with 41,425 arrivals in January-November already exceeding last year’s record 39,910.
Years of conflict in the Sahel region that includes Mali, unemployment and the impact of climate change on farming communities are among the reasons why people attempt the crossing.
One person died among 300 people who arrived on six boats on Friday on the island of El Hierro in the Canaries, according to the Red Cross.
The Atlantic route, which includes departure points in Senegal and Gambia, Mauritania and Morocco, is the world’s deadliest, according to migrant aid group Walking Borders.
In its annual report released this week, the group said 9,757 migrants died at sea in 2024 trying to reach the Spanish archipelago from Africa’s Atlantic coast. A record 10,457 people – or nearly 30 people a day – died attempting to reach Spain this year from all routes, according to the report.
The route departing from Mauritania, which has been particularly well used this year by migrants leaving the Sahel region, was the deadliest, accounting for 6,829 deaths.
Walking Borders blamed a lack of action or arbitrary rescues and the criminalisation of migrants for the surge in deaths at sea, accusing governments of “the prioritisation of immigration control over the right to life”.

Content: The Indian stock market concluded Friday’s session with gains across multiple sectors. Pharma, auto, IT, financial services, FMCG, media, and private banks on Nifty saw active buying, boosting the overall sentiment.
The Sensex rose by 226.59 points, or 0.29%, to close at 78,699.07, while the Nifty 50 index gained 63.20 points, or 0.27%, ending at 23,813.40.
Nifty Bank advanced by 140.60 points, or 0.27%, settling at 51,311.30. However, the broader indices presented a mixed picture. The Nifty Midcap 100 slipped by 145.90 points, or 0.26%, to close at 56,979.80, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 edged up by 27.20 points, or 0.15%, ending at 18,755.85.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), 1,946 shares ended in green, 2,026 closed in red, and 115 remained unchanged.
According to market analysts, subdued trading activity characterized the week, as the absence of major triggers kept participants cautious. Sentiments were further impacted by the anticipated swearing-in of the US Republican Party administration.
Additionally, the Indian rupee touched a new low of 85.54 against the dollar. Analysts attributed this drop to expectations of fewer US Federal Reserve rate cuts, a widening trade deficit, and weak domestic economic growth.
In the Sensex pack, M&M, IndusInd Bank, Tata Motors, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Sun Pharma, Nestle India, ICICI Bank, and Asian Paints emerged as the top gainers. On the other hand, SBI, Tata Steel, Zomato, UltraTech Cement, HCL Tech, L&T, Titan, TCS, and Power Grid were among the top laggards.
Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) sold equities worth ₹2,376.67 crore on December 26, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) were net buyers, purchasing stocks worth ₹3,336.16 crore.

Title: Study shows exercise key to managing chronic liver disease
Publication Date: Fri, 27 Dec 2024 11:11:45 +0000
Content: Exercise is a cornerstone in managing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), according to a study led by an Indian-origin researcher.
MASLD, previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a chronic liver disease that occurs when fat builds up in the liver in people who don’t drink much alcohol. It can affect people with diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol.
The study, led by Hirsh D. Trivedi and team at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in California, US showed that exercise can be beneficial even for patients who have progressed to cirrhosis — severe scarring of the liver.
Besides weight loss, exercise can aid in reducing liver fat, improving inflammation biomarkers, and enhancing cardiovascular health, revealed the study, published in the Liver International journal.
“Personalised exercise regimens should be prioritised for all patients, including those receiving pharmacotherapy,” said the researchers in the paper.
“Exercise is a great therapeutic tool across all stages of liver disease, including advanced liver disease! Would not limit physical activity solely based on liver disease stage and even folks living with cirrhosis can safely and effectively exercise,” said Jonathan G. Stine, part of the research team at the Department of Medicine, at Cedars-Sinai, in a post on the social media platform X.
The findings, based on a review of several pre-clinical and clinical studies showed that increased physical activity, mainly with exercise, is associated with reduced liver disease incidence and better outcomes. The team also urged for adopting an evidence-based, systematic approach to prescribing exercise for MASLD patients.
“Exercise will remain an essential intervention for the management of steatotic liver disease, with the bulk of evidence supporting its benefits in MASLD. Regular physical activity improves insulin sensitivity, reduces hepatic fat accumulation, and lowers biomarkers of liver inflammation,” said the team, calling for more research to refine exercise protocols.

Title: Congress Working Committee to pay homage to former PM Manmohan Singh: KC Venugopal
Publication Date: Fri, 27 Dec 2024 11:10:45 +0000
Content: The Congress Working Committee (CWC) will convene a special meeting today at 5:30 pm at the All India Congress Committee (AICC) headquarters in New Delhi to pay homage to former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh, who passed away on Thursday evening.
Congress General Secretary KC Venugopal confirmed the meeting, stating, “A Congress Working Committee meeting comprising CWC Members, Permanent & Special Invitees is being convened at 5:30 pm today in AICC HQ to pay homage to the former Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh ji.”
Dr. Singh, a towering figure in Indian politics and economics, passed away at the age of 92 at AIIMS Delhi due to age-related health complications. He was rushed to the hospital after a sudden loss of consciousness at home.
Several leaders, including President Droupadi Murmu, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Ministers Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh, BJP President JP Nadda, and Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi, and KC Venugopal, have paid their respects to the former Prime Minister.
In a condolence message, Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge described Singh as “a visionary statesman, a leader of unimpeachable integrity, and an economist of unparalleled stature.” He highlighted Singh’s transformative policies, including the 1991 economic liberalisation reforms, which created India’s middle class and lifted millions out of poverty. “His immense contribution to nation-building will forever be etched in the annals of Indian history,” Kharge said.
Dr. Manmohan Singh served as India’s 13th Prime Minister from 2004 to 2014, becoming the longest-serving Prime Minister after Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi. As Finance Minister in PV Narasimha Rao’s government, Singh spearheaded the 1991 economic reforms, opening India’s economy to foreign investments and reducing government control. His tenure also saw the introduction of landmark policies such as the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and the Right to Information Act (RTI).
The mortal remains of Dr. Singh will be kept at the AICC headquarters in New Delhi for public viewing on Saturday morning from 8:00 am to 10:00 am. According to Congress sources, his cremation will take place near Rajghat, where former Prime Ministers are laid to rest.
Born on September 26, 1932, Dr. Manmohan Singh also served as the Governor of the Reserve Bank of India from 1982 to 1985 and retired earlier this year after a distinguished 33-year tenure in the Rajya Sabha. His passing has left a deep void in Indian politics and public life.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi also expressed his condolences, saying, “India mourns the loss of one of its most distinguished leaders.”

Title: Year-End Review 2024: Key achievements & initiatives of Ministry of Food Processing Industries
Publication Date: Fri, 27 Dec 2024 11:06:26 +0000
Content: In 2024, the Ministry of Food Processing Industries (MoFPI) achieved significant milestones, driving growth in farm incomes, job creation, and reduction of post-harvest losses.
The ministry’s focus on improving infrastructure for preservation and processing, along with its various schemes, has been crucial to developing the food processing sector.
Here’s a recap of the key achievements and initiatives undertaken by MoFPI during the year.
Sectoral Growth and Increased Exports
The processed food sector saw notable growth, with the share of processed food in agri-food exports increasing to 23.4% in 2023-24, a jump from 13.7% in 2014-15.
Additionally, the sector remains one of the largest employment generators in the organized manufacturing segment, contributing 12.41% of total employment in the sector, according to the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) report for 2022-23.
To further support the sector, the Government of India increased the budget allocation for the ministry by 30.19%, raising it to Rs. 3,290 crore for the fiscal year 2024-25.
This financial boost is aimed at enhancing food processing infrastructure and promoting investments across the country.
Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY)
The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Sampada Yojana (PMKSY) continued to be a flagship scheme for the ministry, with 143 new projects approved in 2024.
These projects have already created processing and preservation capacities of 14.41 lakh metric tons, benefiting approximately 3.53 lakh farmers and generating over 57,000 jobs.
Since its inception, 1,646 projects have been approved under PMKSY, resulting in processing capacities of 241.94 lakh metric tons and investment commitments worth Rs. 22,778 crore.
PMKSY has also played a significant role in reducing food wastage. Studies revealed that 70% of completed cold chain projects showed a substantial reduction in wastage, especially in fisheries and dairy products, where wastage was reduced by 70% and 85%, respectively.
Pradhan Mantri Formalisation of Micro Food Processing Enterprises (PMFME) Scheme
Under the PMFME scheme, introduced as part of the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, 46,643 loans were sanctioned in 2024. Additionally, Rs. 254.87 crore was provided as seed capital to 71,714 Self-Help Group (SHG) members.
The scheme, extended until FY 2025-26, aims to formalize and support two lakh micro food processing enterprises with a focus on “One District, One Product.”
A total of 1,14,388 loans have been sanctioned since the launch of the scheme, and Rs. 1,032 crore has been distributed as seed capital assistance.
The ministry also approved 76 incubation centers, with 15 already operational, to assist micro-enterprises with product development.
Production Linked Incentive Scheme (PLISFPI)
The Production Linked Incentive Scheme for Food Processing Industries (PLISFPI) has also shown promising results.
A total of 171 proposals were approved in 2024, leading to an investment of Rs. 8,910 crore and creating 2.89 lakh jobs.
The scheme supports the manufacturing of Ready-to-Eat (RTE) and Ready-to-Cook (RTC) foods, millet-based products, marine products, and mozzarella cheese, among other categories.
World Food India 2024
The global event “World Food India 2024,” held from September 19-22 in New Delhi, showcased India’s food processing potential.
The event attracted over 2,390 foreign delegates, 1,557 exhibitors, and 809 buyers from 108 countries.
Key features included the display of 1,100 pickle varieties and the promotion of 550 ODOP products.
During the event, Rs. 245 crore was sanctioned to support 70,000 SHG members, and Rs. 701 crore in subsidies was disbursed to 25,000 beneficiaries under the PMFME scheme.
Conclusion
The Ministry of Food Processing Industries’ efforts in 2024 have resulted in significant growth in exports, employment, and investments while reducing post-harvest losses.
These achievements have strengthened India’s position as a global leader in food processing, promoting self-reliance and creating opportunities for farmers, micro-enterprises, and industries alike.

Title: NASA confirms Parker Solar Probe safe after record-breaking solar flyby
Publication Date: Fri, 27 Dec 2024 10:54:03 +0000
Content: NASA confirmed on Friday that its Parker Solar Probe is “safe” after becoming the first human-made object in history to fly dangerously close to the Sun.
The US space agency stated that the probe, which made its record-setting close approach of just 6.1 million kilometers (3.8 million miles) from the solar surface on December 24, transmitted a beacon tone on Friday to confirm its health following the flyby.
During its closest approach, known as the perihelion, the spacecraft was not in contact with mission operations on Earth due to its proximity to the Sun. At the time, it was traveling at a staggering speed of approximately 700,000 kilometers per hour (430,000 miles per hour), making it the fastest human-made object in history.
“Parker Solar Probe has confirmed its safe status following its historic solar flyby,” NASA announced on the social media platform X. Michael Buckley, part of the mission operations team at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, added in a NASA blog post that the beacon signal was received just before midnight EST on December 26.
“This close approach marks a significant milestone in our efforts to unlock the mysteries of the Sun. The detailed telemetry data, expected to arrive by January 1, will provide invaluable insights,” Buckley said.
Launched in 2018, the Parker Solar Probe’s mission is to explore the Sun’s outer atmosphere and uncover the origins of phenomena such as the solar wind, which is a continuous flow of charged particles from the Sun. This flyby is the first of the probe’s three final and closest approaches to the Sun’s surface.
“These unprecedented observations will allow scientists to better understand how material in this region heats up to millions of degrees, trace the origins of the solar wind, and study how energetic particles accelerate to near-light speeds,” Buckley explained.
The probe has completed 21 close approaches to the Sun so far, with the most recent perihelion occurring on September 30. These flybys have helped researchers identify the origins of structures in the solar wind and map the outer boundary of the Sun’s atmosphere.
Additionally, the spacecraft used Venus’ gravity to refine its trajectory for the close solar flybys. On November 6, Parker executed its seventh and final gravity-assist maneuver, passing just 387 kilometers above Venus’ surface to set up its record-breaking solar approach.

Content: The Indian women’s team dominated the West Indies once again in a one-sided ODI match, winning by 5 wickets with 22.4 overs to spare.
With this victory, they completed a clean sweep of the three-match series, proving their superiority over the tourists.
Winning the toss, West Indies captain Hayley Mathews opted to bat first, a decision that quickly backfired as their batters struggled against some exceptional bowling from India.
Renuka Singh and Deepti Sharma led the charge with the ball, taking 3 and 5 wickets respectively.
West Indies had a disastrous start, losing both openers for a duck to Renuka Singh, leaving them at 1 for 2.
Wicketkeeper Shermaine Cambelle came in to bat but couldn’t turn the tide. Deandra Dottin also fell cheaply for 5, again to Renuka.
However, Chinelle Henry and Cambelle steadied the ship with a solid 91-run partnership for the fourth wicket.
Ultimately, the West Indies were bundled out for just 162 runs, leaving India with a manageable target.
India’s chase got off to a rocky start with Vice-Captain Smriti Mandhana falling for just 4 runs.
Last match’s centurion, Harleen Deol, also departed early for just 1 run.
However, opener Pratika Rawal (18) and captain Harmanpreet Kaur (32 off 22 balls) forged a crucial partnership, taking the score to 55 before Rawal’s dismissal.
Jemimah Rodrigues contributed 29, while Deepti Sharma (39*) and Richa Ghosh (29) saw India comfortably over the line to win by 5 wickets.
Renuka Singh was named Player of the Series for her remarkable 10 wickets across the three matches.
Deepti Sharma was also recognized for her all-round brilliance, taking 5 wickets for 31 runs and scoring an unbeaten 39 runs.

Title: What is China’s Jinjiang, the BYD contractor under fire in Brazil?
Publication Date: Fri, 27 Dec 2024 10:06:22 +0000
Content: China’s Jinjiang Group is in the spotlight after Brazil’s labour authorities said workers at a factory it is building for electric vehicle maker BYD were victims of human trafficking working in “slavery-like conditions”.
Jinjiang has rejected the claim about workers in slavery-like conditions and not responded to a request for comment on the trafficking allegation. China’s foreign ministry said it is communication with Brazil and that China requires Chinese companies to operate in compliance with the law.
Here is more about Jinjiang Group:
THE COMPANY
Privately held Jinjiang – the name means “gold craftsman” – was founded in 2002 and is qualified to provide property construction services. It is headquartered in Shenzhen, the southern Chinese city that is also home to BYD.
Chairman Ma Jianbin’s alma mater, the Sichuan College of Architectural Technology, posted on social media in 2021 that Jinjiang had a staff of 1,500 and annual revenue of 3 billion yuan ($400 million).
Besides BYD, major clients include Chinese property developers such as Vanke, Longfor and Country Garden, the post said.
Jinjiang is controlled by Ma Jianwei, whose personal information is not available, according to records on Chinese companies database Tianyancha.
JINJIANG’S WORK FOR BYD
Besides the Brazil factory, Jinjiang works on BYD factory construction across China in cities such as Changzhou, Yangzhou and Hefei, according to records on Tianyancha and job posts on Chinese websites and social media.
Jinjiang was seeking workers for the construction of BYD’s plants in Xian, Shaanxi and Zhengzhou, according to job posts by recruiters on the WeChat messaging app last month.
The company helped BYD build its Skyrail elevated monorail system in China, according to local government posts.
Reuters could not establish whether Jinjiang was working on BYD projects in Hungary, Mexico, Thailand and Uzbekistan, but recruitment posts for the firm show that it is hiring various positions in Hungary, including forklift driver and logistics specialist.
Jinjiang is recruiting hydraulic and steel structure engineers in Turkey as well as Turkish, Spanish, Portuguese and Hungarian translators, it said in posts that do not mention BYD.
WORK SAFETY RECORD
From 2018 to 2022, Jinjiang was ordered by Chinese courts to compensate workers in five disputes involving work accidents and injuries, according to Tianyancha.
It was fined in three cases in 2023 and 2024 for violating worker safety regulations, according to the database.
A penalty record also showed that in May 2022, a worker at a construction site of BYD’s in Hefei was killed in a falling accident. Jinjiang, the chief contractor of the project, was fined 310,000 yuan alongside two sub-contractors by the local authorities in 2023 for failing to implement safety measures.

Title: Delhi’s air quality improves; GRAP stage III measures withdrawn
Publication Date: Fri, 27 Dec 2024 15:20:29 +0000
Content: The Centre’s air quality monitoring panel revoked Stage III measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Friday, citing a notable improvement in Delhi’s air quality.
Favourable weather, including persistent rainfall, has played a pivotal role in reducing the Air Quality Index (AQI) to 334 as of 7 PM on December 27, shifting it from the ‘severe’ to ‘poor’ category.
“Given the marked improvement, measures under Stage III of GRAP are being withdrawn,” the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) stated.
While Stage III restrictions have been lifted, measures under Stages I and II remain in effect to ensure sustained air quality levels. “We are committed to preventing a relapse in AQI deterioration. Strict implementation of Stage I and II measures will continue,” said a statement from the panel.
GRAP is a framework of emergency actions designed to combat air pollution in Delhi-NCR based on AQI levels. According to earlier Supreme Court directives, Stage III measures are imposed when AQI surpasses 350, and Stage IV is introduced beyond 400. Both stages were implemented on December 16 when AQI levels soared to 401.
The highest-level restrictions under Stage IV were revoked on December 24 as air quality began to improve. Officials anticipate the AQI will remain in the ‘poor’ category (200-300) in the coming days, supported by ongoing favourable weather conditions.
Despite the rollback of Stage III, construction and industrial activities previously suspended due to violations will remain halted unless explicitly permitted by authorities.
To maintain air quality gains, citizens have been urged to adhere to GRAP’s Citizen Charter. The CAQM stressed its ongoing vigilance. “We continue to closely monitor the situation and will implement additional measures if necessary,” the panel assured.

Title: Rural consumption growth narrows urban-rural gap in India: survey
Publication Date: Fri, 27 Dec 2024 14:33:02 +0000
Content: India’s rural consumption is showing sustained growth, leading to a shrinking gap between urban and rural expenditure, according to the latest Household Consumption Survey released by the Ministry of Statistics.
The survey highlights that the urban-rural gap in monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) decreased further in 2023-24. In 2011-12, this gap stood at 84% but fell to 71% in 2022-23 and further narrowed to 70% in 2023-24.
The average MPCE for rural areas in 2023-24 is estimated at ₹4,122, while urban areas reported ₹6,996. These figures exclude the value of goods received free of cost under social welfare schemes. When accounting for these benefits, the MPCE rises to ₹4,247 for rural areas and ₹7,078 for urban households.
In nominal terms, the survey notes a 9% increase in rural MPCE and an 8% rise in urban MPCE compared to 2022-23. The largest growth in MPCE was observed among the bottom 5-10% of the population in both rural and urban areas, signaling a trend toward more equitable economic growth.
Non-food items continued to dominate household spending, contributing 53% of MPCE in rural areas and 60% in urban regions. Key components of non-food expenditure included transportation, clothing, durable goods, and entertainment.
Within food expenditure, beverages, refreshments, and processed foods maintained the highest share in both rural and urban households. For urban households, rent—including housing, garage, and hotel charges—constituted 7% of non-food spending.
The Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, showed a decline in both rural and urban areas. For rural regions, the coefficient dropped from 0.266 in 2022-23 to 0.237 in 2023-24. Similarly, in urban areas, it fell from 0.314 to 0.284 during the same period, reflecting reduced consumption disparity.
The survey, conducted between August 2023 and July 2024, collected data from 2,61,953 households nationwide, including 1,54,357 rural and 1,07,596 urban households.

Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya expressed condolences, recognizing Singh’s pivotal role in strengthening India-Japan ties. Letters sent to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Foreign Minister S. Jaishankar highlighted Singh’s contributions to elevating bilateral relations.
During Singh’s visit to Japan in December 2006, he upgraded the partnership between the two nations to a “Global and Strategic Partnership,” further advancing the cooperation established in 2000 under former Indian PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Japanese PM Yoshiro Mori.

Title: At least 69 migrants killed in shipwreck off Morocco on deadly route to Spain
Publication Date: Fri, 27 Dec 2024 12:39:39 +0000
Content: At least 69 people died after a boat headed from West Africa to the Canary Islands capsized off Morocco on Dec. 19, Malian authorities said, as data showed deaths of migrants attempting to reach Spain surged to an all-time high in 2024.
The makeshift boat was carrying around 80 people when it capsized. Only 11 survived, the Ministry of Malians Abroad said in a statement on Thursday, after collecting information to reconstruct the incident.
A crisis unit has been set up to monitor the situation, it added.
The Atlantic migration route from the coast of West Africa to Spain’s Canary Islands, typically used by African migrants trying to reach mainland Spain, has seen a surge this year, with 41,425 arrivals in January-November already exceeding last year’s record 39,910.
Years of conflict in the Sahel region that includes Mali, unemployment and the impact of climate change on farming communities are among the reasons why people attempt the crossing.
One person died among 300 people who arrived on six boats on Friday on the island of El Hierro in the Canaries, according to the Red Cross.
The Atlantic route, which includes departure points in Senegal and Gambia, Mauritania and Morocco, is the world’s deadliest, according to migrant aid group Walking Borders.
In its annual report released this week, the group said 9,757 migrants died at sea in 2024 trying to reach the Spanish archipelago from Africa’s Atlantic coast. A record 10,457 people – or nearly 30 people a day – died attempting to reach Spain this year from all routes, according to the report.
The route departing from Mauritania, which has been particularly well used this year by migrants leaving the Sahel region, was the deadliest, accounting for 6,829 deaths.
Walking Borders blamed a lack of action or arbitrary rescues and the criminalisation of migrants for the surge in deaths at sea, accusing governments of “the prioritisation of immigration control over the right to life”.

Content: The Indian stock market concluded Friday’s session with gains across multiple sectors. Pharma, auto, IT, financial services, FMCG, media, and private banks on Nifty saw active buying, boosting the overall sentiment.
The Sensex rose by 226.59 points, or 0.29%, to close at 78,699.07, while the Nifty 50 index gained 63.20 points, or 0.27%, ending at 23,813.40.
Nifty Bank advanced by 140.60 points, or 0.27%, settling at 51,311.30. However, the broader indices presented a mixed picture. The Nifty Midcap 100 slipped by 145.90 points, or 0.26%, to close at 56,979.80, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 edged up by 27.20 points, or 0.15%, ending at 18,755.85.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), 1,946 shares ended in green, 2,026 closed in red, and 115 remained unchanged.
According to market analysts, subdued trading activity characterized the week, as the absence of major triggers kept participants cautious. Sentiments were further impacted by the anticipated swearing-in of the US Republican Party administration.
Additionally, the Indian rupee touched a new low of 85.54 against the dollar. Analysts attributed this drop to expectations of fewer US Federal Reserve rate cuts, a widening trade deficit, and weak domestic economic growth.
In the Sensex pack, M&M, IndusInd Bank, Tata Motors, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, Sun Pharma, Nestle India, ICICI Bank, and Asian Paints emerged as the top gainers. On the other hand, SBI, Tata Steel, Zomato, UltraTech Cement, HCL Tech, L&T, Titan, TCS, and Power Grid were among the top laggards.

Title: Study shows exercise key to managing chronic liver disease
Publication Date: Fri, 27 Dec 2024 11:11:45 +0000
Content: Exercise is a cornerstone in managing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), according to a study led by an Indian-origin researcher.
MASLD, previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a chronic liver disease that occurs when fat builds up in the liver in people who don’t drink much alcohol. It can affect people with diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol.
The study, led by Hirsh D. Trivedi and team at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in California, US showed that exercise can be beneficial even for patients who have progressed to cirrhosis — severe scarring of the liver.
Besides weight loss, exercise can aid in reducing liver fat, improving inflammation biomarkers, and enhancing cardiovascular health, revealed the study, published in the Liver International journal.
“Personalised exercise regimens should be prioritised for all patients, including those receiving pharmacotherapy,” said the researchers in the paper.
“Exercise is a great therapeutic tool across all stages of liver disease, including advanced liver disease! Would not limit physical activity solely based on liver disease stage and even folks living with cirrhosis can safely and effectively exercise,” said Jonathan G. Stine, part of the research team at the Department of Medicine, at Cedars-Sinai, in a post on the social media platform X.
The findings, based on a review of several pre-clinical and clinical studies showed that increased physical activity, mainly with exercise, is associated with reduced liver disease incidence and better outcomes. The team also urged for adopting an evidence-based, systematic approach to prescribing exercise for MASLD patients.
“Exercise will remain an essential intervention for the management of steatotic liver disease, with the bulk of evidence supporting its benefits in MASLD. Regular physical activity improves insulin sensitivity, reduces hepatic fat accumulation, and lowers biomarkers of liver inflammation,” said the team, calling for more research to refine exercise protocols.

Title: AUS vs IND, 4th Test, Day 3: Nitish Kumar Reddy bails India out with maiden ton as bad light stops play at the MCG
Publication Date: Sat, 28 Dec 2024 07:28:39 +0000
Content: By: Aditya Ahuja
Indian batter Nitish Kumar Reddy slammed his maiden international century on Day 3 of the Boxing Day Test in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia on Saturday, helping India make a miraculous return to the third Test.
In the final session of the day, Nitish Kumar Reddy, while standing at 99, blasted the ball towards the mid-on fielder for a four and brought up his maiden international century in style.
The atmosphere at the MCG was charged with emotion as Nitish’s father, overwhelmed with joy, shed tears and raised his hands in gratitude to the heavens.
As Nitish made his way back to the pavilion after his knock, he was greeted with warm appreciation from the Australian players and a standing ovation from the Indian camp.
Nitish remains unbeaten at 105 runs from 176 balls at a strike rate of 59.66. He struck 10 fours and 1 six during his time at the crease.
With his ton, the youngster also achieved an elusive feat as he became the third youngest Indian batter to score a maiden Test century in Australia, after Sachin Tendulkar and Rishabh Pant.
Tendulkar tops the chart, having scored his maiden Test century at the age of 18 years and 256 days in 1992. India wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant holds second place, following his maiden Test century at the age of 21 years and 92 days in Sydney in 2019. Meanwhile, Nitish achieved the milestone at the age of 21 years and 216 days.
The visitors started the third and final session at 326/7, with Washington Sundar (40*) and Nitish Kumar Reddy (85*) unbeaten at the crease.
Washington and Nitish displayed immense discipline, forging a 127-run partnership and bailing India out of a gloomy situation on a damp evening.
The light conditions deteriorated in Melbourne as it started drizzling, after which the umpires were forced to call for early stumps on Day 3.
At stumps on Day 3, India stood at 358/9, with Nitish (105*) and Mohammed Siraj (2*) unbeaten at the crease. The visitors still trail by 116 runs.

Paying tribute to the late Dr. Singh, Congress leader Madhusudan Mistry said that he made lifelong laws that benefited crores of people. “His demise is a loss for everyone,” he added.
Congress leader Mumtaz Patel said, “Today, India has lost a great man. He was not just a good leader but also a very good human being. People called him a weak Prime Minister, but that was absolutely wrong. He always worked for the country; he was a strong and kind person.”
Congress MP Manish Tewari said, “Today is a very poignant moment. A very fine person, a renowned economist, and a world statesman is no longer with us… It is a sad day not only for India but for the world… He lived a very noble and simple life… May his soul rest in peace…”
The mortal remains were kept at the All India Congress Committee (AICC) headquarters early Saturday morning for party workers to pay their final respects.

Publication Date: Sat, 28 Dec 2024 05:33:09 +0000
Content: US President Joe Biden expressed condolences on the passing of former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, recognizing his contributions to US-India relations and global cooperation.
“Jill and I join the people of India in grieving the loss of former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh,” President Biden said in an official statement from the White House on Friday.
“The unprecedented level of cooperation between the United States and India today would not have been possible without the Prime Minister’s strategic vision and political courage. From forging the US-India Civil Nuclear Agreement to helping launch the first Quad between Indo-Pacific partners, he charted pathbreaking progress that will continue to strengthen our nations—and the world—for generations to come. He was a true statesman, a dedicated public servant, and above all, a kind and humble person.”
Biden also recalled his meetings with Dr. Singh during key moments in their professional lives. “I had the chance to meet Prime Minister Singh as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2008 and as Vice President during his official state visit to the United States in 2009. He also graciously hosted me in New Delhi in 2013.”
“As we discussed then, the US-India relationship is among the most consequential in the world. And together, as partners and friends, our nations can unlock a future of dignity and unlimited potential for all of our people,” he continued, as per the statement.
Dr. Singh, who passed away on Thursday night due to age-related medical conditions, is remembered for his role in shaping India’s modern economic landscape. His legacy includes the economic liberalization reforms he introduced as Finance Minister in 1991, which opened India’s economy to global markets.
During his tenure as Prime Minister from 2004 to 2014, Dr. Singh worked to strengthen India’s global standing, especially in its relationship with the United States, and foster regional cooperation through initiatives like BRICS.
Singh will be cremated near Rajghat, where many prominent Indian leaders are laid to rest.
“During this difficult time, we recommit to this vision to which Prime Minister Singh dedicated his life,” Biden concluded. “Jill and I send our deepest condolences to former First Lady Gursharan Kaur, their three children, and all the people of India.”

Title: US: Divide in Trump’s camp as Musk, Ramaswamy face backlash after advocating visas for ‘skilled’ workers
Publication Date: Sat, 28 Dec 2024 05:28:57 +0000
Content: A major divide has emerged within Donald Trump’s MAGA team in the United States, as Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who advocated for the expansion of the visa program for “highly skilled workers,” faced heavy backlash from within President-elect Trump’s base, CNN reported.
Musk and Ramaswamy, both foreign-born leaders heading Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), have reignited the debate over H-1B visas, reflecting a divide over immigration policy as Trump prepares to assume office.
In a series of posts on X (formerly Twitter), Musk emphasized the importance of attracting top engineering talent to maintain America’s technological edge. “The number of people who are super talented engineers AND super motivated in the USA is far too low,” he said.
“Think of this like a pro sports team: If you want your TEAM to win the championship, you need to recruit top talent wherever they may be. That enables the whole TEAM to win,” Musk added.
He further elaborated, “I am referring to bringing in, via legal immigration, the top ~0.1 percent of engineering talent as being essential for America to keep winning. Thinking of America as a pro sports team that has been winning for a long time and wants to keep winning is the right mental construct,” the Trump aide added.
Ramaswamy, a first-generation American and Trump’s appointee to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, echoed Musk’s sentiments. He argued that cultural stagnation and a preference for mediocrity have led to a reliance on foreign-born talent.
Citing examples from 1990s sitcoms, Ramaswamy remarked, “Our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long (at least since the ’90s and likely longer). That doesn’t start in college, it starts YOUNG. A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers.”
Musk and Ramaswamy’s support for foreign workers has drawn sharp criticism from Trump loyalists who prioritize curbing immigration. Figures such as Laura Loomer, Ann Coulter, and former Congressman Matt Gaetz expressed their displeasure, accusing the two of undermining the “America First” ethos.
Gaetz posted on X, “We did not ask them to engineer an immigration policy.”
“We welcomed the tech bros when they came running our way to avoid the 3rd grade teacher picking their kid’s gender, and the obvious Biden/Harris economic decline. We did not ask them to engineer an immigration policy,” Gaetz added.
Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley also weighed in, opposing their stance. Haley, who has advocated for prioritizing American workers, stated, “There is nothing wrong with American workers or American culture. All you have to do is look at the border and see how many want what we have. We should be investing in and prioritizing Americans, not foreign workers.”
Notably, the H-1B visa program allows highly skilled foreign workers to enter the US, filling roles often in the technology sector. Proponents argue the program enhances American competitiveness by addressing the talent shortage in critical industries. Critics, however, worry that reliance on foreign workers undermines opportunities for American citizens, reported CNN.
During Trump’s first term, the administration imposed restrictions on H-1B visas, citing concerns over abuse and economic strain. In 2016, Trump condemned the program, describing it as a means for companies to replace American workers with lower-paid foreign employees. Restrictions tightened further in 2020 in response to economic challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
However, the President-elect has recently signaled a shift, suggesting that foreign nationals graduating from US universities should be granted permanent residency. “What I want to do, and what I will do, is—if you graduate from a college, I think you should automatically, as part of your diploma, receive a green card to be able to stay in this country,” Trump said during a podcast interview earlier this year.
The debate has drawn bipartisan attention. Colorado Governor Jared Polis commended Musk and Ramaswamy for acknowledging the value of immigrant entrepreneurs. “There are millions of Americans that work for companies founded by immigrants. Those jobs wouldn’t exist today if we didn’t let those immigrants in,” Polis said. However, he also highlighted the importance of lower-skilled immigrant labor in sectors like agriculture and construction, urging a balanced approach.
As Trump’s administration takes shape, the contrasting viewpoints on immigration policy reveal deeper ideological divisions within his coalition. While figures like Musk and Ramaswamy advocate for leveraging global talent to bolster the economy, others in Trump’s orbit remain steadfast in their calls to prioritize American labor and restrict immigration, according to CNN.
Musk’s rising influence within Trump’s circle has not gone unnoticed. Following his opposition to a bipartisan government funding bill, Democrats have labeled Musk “President Musk,” suggesting his sway over Trump’s policy agenda.
Trump has dismissed these claims, stating, “No, he’s not taking the presidency. I like having smart people. They’re on a new kick. ‘Russia, Russia, Russia,’ ‘Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine,’ all the different hoaxes. The new one is ‘President Trump has ceded the presidency to Elon Musk.’ No, no, that’s not happening.”

A member of the Rajya Sabha for over three decades, Dr. Singh retired earlier this year after 33 years of distinguished service in Parliament.
Condolences have poured in from across the country and the world, reflecting the profound impact of Dr. Singh’s life and work. His demise marks the end of an era in Indian politics and economics.
Dr. Manmohan Singh will be remembered as a visionary leader, an architect of modern India’s economic transformation, and a staunch advocate for transparency and inclusivity in governance.

Title: Delhi’s air quality improves; GRAP stage III measures withdrawn
Publication Date: Fri, 27 Dec 2024 15:20:29 +0000
Content: The Centre’s air quality monitoring panel revoked Stage III measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) on Friday, citing a notable improvement in Delhi’s air quality.
Favourable weather, including persistent rainfall, has played a pivotal role in reducing the Air Quality Index (AQI) to 334 as of 7 PM on December 27, shifting it from the ‘severe’ to ‘poor’ category.
“Given the marked improvement, measures under Stage III of GRAP are being withdrawn,” the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) stated.
While Stage III restrictions have been lifted, measures under Stages I and II remain in effect to ensure sustained air quality levels. “We are committed to preventing a relapse in AQI deterioration. Strict implementation of Stage I and II measures will continue,” said a statement from the panel.
GRAP is a framework of emergency actions designed to combat air pollution in Delhi-NCR based on AQI levels. According to earlier Supreme Court directives, Stage III measures are imposed when AQI surpasses 350, and Stage IV is introduced beyond 400. Both stages were implemented on December 16 when AQI levels soared to 401.
The highest-level restrictions under Stage IV were revoked on December 24 as air quality began to improve. Officials anticipate the AQI will remain in the ‘poor’ category (200-300) in the coming days, supported by ongoing favourable weather conditions.
Despite the rollback of Stage III, construction and industrial activities previously suspended due to violations will remain halted unless explicitly permitted by authorities.
To maintain air quality gains, citizens have been urged to adhere to GRAP’s Citizen Charter. The CAQM stressed its ongoing vigilance. “We continue to closely monitor the situation and will implement additional measures if necessary,” the panel assured.

Title: Rural consumption growth narrows urban-rural gap in India: survey
Publication Date: Fri, 27 Dec 2024 14:33:02 +0000
Content: India’s rural consumption is showing sustained growth, leading to a shrinking gap between urban and rural expenditure, according to the latest Household Consumption Survey released by the Ministry of Statistics.
The survey highlights that the urban-rural gap in monthly per capita consumption expenditure (MPCE) decreased further in 2023-24. In 2011-12, this gap stood at 84% but fell to 71% in 2022-23 and further narrowed to 70% in 2023-24.
The average MPCE for rural areas in 2023-24 is estimated at ₹4,122, while urban areas reported ₹6,996. These figures exclude the value of goods received free of cost under social welfare schemes. When accounting for these benefits, the MPCE rises to ₹4,247 for rural areas and ₹7,078 for urban households.
In nominal terms, the survey notes a 9% increase in rural MPCE and an 8% rise in urban MPCE compared to 2022-23. The largest growth in MPCE was observed among the bottom 5-10% of the population in both rural and urban areas, signaling a trend toward more equitable economic growth.
Non-food items continued to dominate household spending, contributing 53% of MPCE in rural areas and 60% in urban regions. Key components of non-food expenditure included transportation, clothing, durable goods, and entertainment.
Within food expenditure, beverages, refreshments, and processed foods maintained the highest share in both rural and urban households. For urban households, rent—including housing, garage, and hotel charges—constituted 7% of non-food spending.
The Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, showed a decline in both rural and urban areas. For rural regions, the coefficient dropped from 0.266 in 2022-23 to 0.237 in 2023-24. Similarly, in urban areas, it fell from 0.314 to 0.284 during the same period, reflecting reduced consumption disparity.
The survey, conducted between August 2023 and July 2024, collected data from 2,61,953 households nationwide, including 1,54,357 rural and 1,07,596 urban households.
