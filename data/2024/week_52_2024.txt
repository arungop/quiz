Title: Students wanted to postpone exams, sent bomb threats to their own schools: Delhi Police
Publication Date: Sun, 22 Dec 2024 10:12:52 +0000
Content: The Delhi Police revealed on Sunday that bomb threat emails sent to two schools in Rohini were sent by their own students. According to the police, the students sent the emails in an attempt to postpone their exams as they were unprepared.
“After an investigation by the Special Cell of Delhi Police, it was found that the emails were sent by two different students from the same school. Both students admitted to sending the emails to avoid their exams,” a Delhi Police official said.
“Since both were minors, they were counselled and released,” the police added.
On December 14, the Delhi Police Special Cell identified a student from a private school as the sender of a bomb threat email to a school in Paschim Vihar. Upon tracing the IP address, the police located the student’s home. During questioning, the student confessed to the act and was subsequently counselled. The police issued a warning to his parents to monitor his behaviour.
Between December 13 and 17, several schools in Delhi received bomb threat emails, with a total of 30 schools being targeted with hoax threats on December 13 alone.
On November 19, the Delhi High Court directed the Delhi government and police to devise a comprehensive action plan, including a detailed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), to handle bomb threats and related emergencies. The court set an eight-week deadline for implementing these measures.

Title: AI reveals hidden hazards of chemical mixtures in rivers: Study
Publication Date: Sun, 22 Dec 2024 10:11:50 +0000
Content: Artificial intelligence can provide significant insights into how complex chemical mixtures in rivers affect aquatic life, paving the way for more effective environmental protection.
A novel methodology developed by academics at the University of Birmingham demonstrates how advanced artificial intelligence (AI) approaches can help identify potentially harmful chemicals in rivers by monitoring their effects on small water fleas (Daphnia).
The team collaborated with scientists from the Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES) in China and the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) in Germany to analyze water samples from the Chaobai River system near Beijing. This river system is exposed to chemical pollutants from various sources, including agriculture, domestic use, and industry.
Professor John Colbourne, director of the University of Birmingham’s Centre for Environmental Research and Justice and a senior author of the paper, expressed optimism about the technology’s potential. He said:
“There is a vast array of chemicals in the environment. Water safety cannot be assessed one substance at a time. Now we have the means to monitor the totality of chemicals in environmental water samples to uncover unknown substances acting together to produce toxicity to animals, including humans.”
The results, published in Environmental Science and Technology, reveal that certain chemical mixtures can interact to impact critical biological processes in aquatic organisms, as indicated by changes in their genes. These chemical combinations create environmental hazards potentially greater than those posed by individual substances.
The research team used water fleas (Daphnia) as test organisms due to their sensitivity to water quality changes and their genetic similarities with other species, making them excellent indicators of environmental hazards.
“Our innovative approach leverages Daphnia as a sentinel species to uncover potential toxic substances in the environment,” explained Dr. Xiaojing Li of the University of Birmingham and the study’s lead author.
“By using AI methods, we can identify which subsets of chemicals might be particularly harmful to aquatic life, even at low concentrations that wouldn’t normally raise concerns.”
Dr. Jiarui Zhou, also at the University of Birmingham and co-first author, led the development of the AI algorithms. He said:
“Our approach demonstrates how advanced computational methods can help solve pressing environmental challenges. By analyzing vast amounts of biological and chemical data simultaneously, we can better understand and predict environmental risks.”
Professor Luisa Orsini, another senior author, emphasized the innovation in their methodology:
“The study’s key breakthrough lies in our data-driven, unbiased approach to uncovering how environmentally relevant concentrations of chemical mixtures can cause harm. This challenges conventional ecotoxicology and paves the way for regulatory adoption of the sentinel species Daphnia, alongside new methodological approaches.”
Dr. Timothy Williams, a co-author from the University of Birmingham, noted:
“Typically, aquatic toxicology studies either use high concentrations of individual chemicals to determine detailed biological responses or only measure apical effects, such as mortality and altered reproduction, after exposure to an environmental sample. This study breaks new ground by identifying key classes of chemicals affecting living organisms within genuine environmental mixtures at relatively low concentrations, while simultaneously characterizing the biomolecular changes they elicit.”

Title: Suspect in German Christmas market attack held on murder charges after night of grief, scuffles
Publication Date: Sun, 22 Dec 2024 10:06:19 +0000
Content: A man suspected of driving a car into a German Christmas market in an attack that killed at least five people and injured scores of others faces charges of murder and attempted murder, police said on Sunday, after the man was remanded in custody.
Police in the central city of Magdeburg where the attack happened on Friday also reported scuffles at a far-right demonstration attended by around 2,100 people on Saturday night, while other residents took part in sombre remembrance events.
The suspect is a 50-year-old man from Saudi Arabia who has lived in Germany for almost two decades.
A magistrate ordered the man, identified in German media as Taleb A., into pretrial custody after prosecutors pressed charges of murder on five counts, multiple counts of attempted murder and grievous bodily harm, according to a police statement.
It identified the dead as a nine-year-old boy and four adult women, aged 52, 45, 75 and 67.
German authorities have not named the suspect, who has permanent resident status in Germany, and media reports do not give his full name in keeping with local privacy laws.
Police reported scuffles at a protest attended by around 2,100 people on Saturday night, one day after the attack. Right-wingers had billed the gathering on messaging app Telegram as a “demonstration against terror”.
Protesters wearing black balaclavas could be seen holding a large banner with the word ‘remigration’, a term popular with far-right supporters seeking the mass deportation of migrants and people deemed not ethnically German.
The motive in Friday night’s attack remains unclear. Investigators are probing the suspect’s criticism of German authorities’ treatment of Saudi refugees, among other things. He was also a staunch critic of Islam and had voiced support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party on social media platform X.

Title: India’s forest cover increases by 1,445 square km, ISFR 2023 shows
Publication Date: Sun, 22 Dec 2024 09:04:48 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Bhupender Yadav, on Saturday released the ‘India State of Forest Report 2023’ (ISFR 2023) at the Forest Research Institute in Dehradun. This report, published biennially by the Forest Survey of India (FSI) since 1987, offers a comprehensive assessment of India’s forest and tree resources, based on satellite data and field-based surveys. The 2023 report marks the 18th edition of this significant publication.
The ISFR 2023 provides crucial information on the country’s forest cover, tree cover, mangrove cover, growing stock, carbon stock, and instances of forest fires. It also highlights the role of agroforestry in India. According to the latest assessment, the total forest and tree cover in India stands at 827,357 square kilometers, representing 25.17 percent of the country’s total geographical area. Of this, 715,343 square kilometers (21.76%) is classified as forest cover, while 112,014 square kilometers (3.41%) is tree cover.
Yadav expressed satisfaction over the increase in the country’s forest and tree cover, which has grown by 1,445 square kilometers since the 2021 assessment. This includes an increase of 156 square kilometers in forest cover and 1,289 square kilometers in tree cover. He also emphasized the advanced technology used by FSI for real-time fire alerts and forest fire services, which help in better forest management.
In terms of the top-performing states, Chhattisgarh led with an increase of 684 square kilometers in forest and tree cover, followed by Uttar Pradesh and Odisha, each with a 559 square kilometer increase, and Rajasthan, with a 394 square kilometer increase. Mizoram, Gujarat, and Odisha were the top three states showing the largest increase in forest cover, with Mizoram seeing an increase of 242 square kilometers, followed by Gujarat (180 square kilometers) and Odisha (152 square kilometers).
The report also provides a state-wise analysis of forest and tree cover, with Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, and Maharashtra leading in total area covered by forests and trees. Madhya Pradesh alone accounts for 85,724 square kilometers of forest and tree cover, while Arunachal Pradesh and Maharashtra follow with 67,083 and 65,383 square kilometers, respectively. In terms of forest cover relative to total geographical area, Lakshadweep (91.33%) has the highest percentage, followed by Mizoram (85.34%) and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands (81.62%).
The assessment also reveals that 19 states and union territories have more than 33 percent of their geographical area under forest cover, with eight states—Mizoram, Lakshadweep, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Manipur—boasting forest cover exceeding 75 percent.
In terms of other environmental resources, India’s mangrove cover is estimated at 4,992 square kilometers. The growing stock, which includes timber and other forest products, has increased by 262 million cubic meters compared to the previous assessment. Bamboo-bearing areas have also seen growth, with an increase of 5,227 square kilometers, reaching a total of 154,670 square kilometers. The potential annual timber production from trees outside forests has been estimated at 91.51 million cubic meters.
The carbon stock in India’s forests is another key highlight of the report. The current estimate stands at 7,285.5 million tonnes, marking an increase of 81.5 million tonnes from the last assessment. Furthermore, the report shows that India has already exceeded its carbon sequestration target under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), with a carbon stock of 30.43 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent, surpassing the 2.29 billion tonnes of additional carbon sink goal set for 2030.
The ISFR 2023 not only offers valuable insights into the health of India’s forests but also serves as a vital resource for policymakers, environmental planners, state forest departments, research organizations, and academic institutions. It provides essential data that aids in the conservation and sustainable management of the country’s natural resources.

Title: Atletico go top as late Sorloth goal earns dramatic 2-1 win at Barcelona
Publication Date: Sun, 22 Dec 2024 05:08:37 +0000
Content: Alexander Sorloth struck deep in stoppage time to hand Atletico Madrid a 2-1 comeback win at Barcelona on Saturday that moved them top of LaLiga with their 12th consecutive victory across all competitions.
Pedri put the hosts ahead in the first half but Rodrigo De Paul levelled after the break before Sorloth inflicted a third straight home league defeat on Barca and knocked them off the LaLiga summit.
It was Atletico’s first away win at Barcelona in 18 years and they now have 41 points with a game in hand, three ahead of the Catalans who have gone three league games without a win.
“It’s very tough. We had chances to seal the win. If you don’t put the game to bed, this happens,” Pedri told Movistar.
“Our home is where it has to be difficult to beat us. We have to improve a lot. We have to reset ourselves mentally and physically.”
Barca were the better side in the opening exchanges and Pedri scored on the half-hour mark following a great run into the box and a one-two with Gavi, beating goalkeeper Jan Oblak with a low shot.
Despite their dominance, the hosts were unable to extend their lead after the break as Raphinha’s chip hit the crossbar and Oblak blocked Fermin Lopez’s close-range shot with his feet.
Robert Lewandowski also failed to find the net as his poor shot from inside the six-yard box was also saved by Oblak.
De Paul then grabbed the equaliser in the 60th minute, capitalising on a poor clearance by Marc Casado on the edge of the box to slot his shot into the bottom corner with what was only Atletico’s second attempt on goal in the game.
“When you suffer more, you enjoy it more. We were up against a great rival. It had been many years since Atletico had won here, and we were also playing for the top spot,” De Paul said.
“It’s exciting to be leaders. It’s a huge satisfaction. When your work pays off, you feel completely satisfied. It’s an honour to wear this shirt, and when things go well it gives me great joy.”
Oblak pulled off a couple of key saves to deny Raphinha and Pedri before substitute Sorloth netted with a first-time effort six minutes into stoppage time from a deep cross by Nahuel Molina.
“I hadn’t won in Barcelona since I arrived, finally. It was difficult, but we got three points. Let’s continue in this vein,” Oblak said.
“We started badly, with some fear that nobody understands, because we are in very good shape. After the 1-0 we were able to hold on without conceding the second.
“The league is very long. Today is not key, it’s three points and there are a lot of points left. A month and a half ago we were far away and now we are here.”

Title: Rozgar Mela: PM Modi stresses modern education and employment opportunities for youth, women
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 07:24:54 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized the need for a robust and modern education system to harness the potential of the country’s youth, during the distribution of 71,000 appointment letters to newly recruited personnel on Monday. Highlighting the transformative impact of the National Education Policy (NEP), he outlined how it is paving the way for building a “New India.”
“To take the country forward, it is essential to nurture the potential of youth talent. This responsibility lies with the country’s education system,” the Prime Minister said, adding that the NEP addresses long-standing challenges and introduces greater flexibility. “Earlier, due to various restrictions, the education system became a burden on students. Now, it offers them new options,” he remarked.
The Prime Minister further pointed out how linguistic barriers once hindered opportunities for youth, particularly from rural, Dalit, backward, and tribal communities. In response, his government introduced measures like teaching in mother tongues and conducting exams in regional languages. Recruitment exams are now available in 13 languages, and targeted initiatives are underway, such as special recruitment rallies in border areas. Over 50,000 youths have already received appointment letters in the Central Armed Police Forces through these efforts.
The Prime Minister detailed the government’s initiatives to create employment in rural areas, particularly in the agriculture sector. Efforts such as the Gobardhan Yojana, which established Gobar Gas plants nationwide, have generated numerous jobs while producing clean energy. Similarly, linking agricultural markets to the e-NAM platform and increasing ethanol blending in fuel to 20% have not only supported farmers but also created additional employment in associated industries.
PM Modi also underscored his government’s focus on empowering women across all sectors. He highlighted the provision of appointment letters to thousands of women recruits as a step toward making them more self-reliant.
“Our efforts are aimed at removing every barrier that hinders women’s progress. Initiatives such as extending maternity leave to 26 weeks, building toilets in schools under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, and opening Jan Dhan accounts for 30 crore women have been transformative,” the Prime Minister said. He also mentioned the ‘Mudra Yojana,’ which offers collateral-free loans to women, and noted that most homes built under the PM Awas Yojana are registered in women’s names.

Title: PM Modi distributes 71,000 appointment letters to newly appointed recruits, says, “Development of country happens through its youth”
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 06:33:41 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday distributed over 71,000 appointment letters to newly appointed recruits via video conferencing.
The event was part of the Centre’s Rozgar Mela initiative, designed to empower youth by creating job opportunities and encouraging their active participation in nation-building.
In his address, PM Modi shared his recent experience in Kuwait, where he concluded a two-day visit on Sunday. During the trip, he had the opportunity to engage with young Indian professionals working there.
“I had several insightful discussions with India’s youth in Kuwait. Upon returning, my first program is with the youth of the country. I extend my heartfelt congratulations to all the newly appointed recruits and their families,” he said.
PM Modi emphasized that harnessing the potential and talent of India’s youth remains the government’s top priority.
“Through Rozgar Mela, we are working continuously to create job opportunities. Over the last decade, various ministries, departments, and institutions have been running campaigns to offer government jobs. Today alone, more than 71,000 young people have been appointed. In the past 1.5 years, our government has provided permanent government jobs to nearly 10 lakh youth, setting a remarkable record,” he said.
PM Modi contrasted this with previous administrations, highlighting the lack of similar large-scale efforts to provide permanent government jobs.
“Unlike in the past, where such initiatives didn’t exist in mission mode, today millions of youth are receiving jobs through a system that is both transparent and fair,” PM Modi said.
Stressing the critical role of youth in nation-building, the Prime Minister said, “The strength and leadership of our youth are central to India’s development. We have all taken a pledge to build a developed India by 2047, and this vision is grounded in the talent of our youth. Over the past decade, initiatives like Make in India, Atmanirbhar Bharat, Startup India, Standup India, and Digital India have all been designed with young people at their core. India has transformed its policies in areas like space exploration and defence manufacturing, and the youth have been the biggest beneficiaries.”
PM Modi also highlighted the government’s commitment to providing comprehensive support to young people in their pursuits.
“Today, when a young person starts a business, they are met with an entire ecosystem that supports their growth. Those pursuing careers in sports do so with the confidence that they will succeed. India is now the second-largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world, and across sectors—from renewable energy to organic farming, space exploration to defence, tourism to wellness—India is scaling new heights,” he added.
Invoking Chaudhary Charan Singh’s legacy on ‘Kisan Diwas,’ PM Modi underscored the Centre’s ongoing efforts toward rural development and farmer upliftment.
He highlighted employment-focused initiatives such as Bima Suraksha, Lakhpati Didi, and Drone Didi, which are aimed at empowering rural communities and supporting farmers.
He also lauded the participation of women in the Rozgar Mela, saying, “Today, many women have received their appointment letters. I hope they inspire others. Schemes such as Sukanya Samruddhi Yojana, Jan Dhan Bank accounts, and Mudra Yojana enable women to pursue education without financial worries.”
The Prime Minister also mentioned that under the PM Awas Yojana, maximum houses are under the name of women.
The Rozgar Mela is being held across 45 locations nationwide, recruiting for various ministries and departments, including the Ministry of Home Affairs, Department of Posts, Department of Higher Education, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and the Department of Financial Services.
According to a government release, the Rozgar Mela aligns with the Prime Minister’s commitment to job creation, providing meaningful opportunities for youth to contribute to nation-building and achieve self-empowerment.

Title: Netanyahu says Israel will continue to act against the Houthis
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 06:27:36 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday Israel would continue acting against the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, whom he accused of threatening world shipping and the international order, and called on Israelis to be steadfast.
“Just as we acted forcefully against the terrorist arms of Iran’s axis of evil, so we will act against the Houthis,” he said in a video statement a day after a missile fired from Yemen fell in the Tel Aviv area, causing a number of mild injuries.
On Thursday, Israeli jets launched a series of strikes against energy and port infrastructure in Yemen in a move officials said was a response to hundreds of missile and drone attacks launched by the Houthis since the start of the Gaza war 14 months ago.
On Saturday, the U.S. military said it conducted precision airstrikes against a missile storage facility and a command-and-control facility operated by Houthis in Yemen’s capital, Sanaa.
Netanyahu, strengthened at home by the Israeli military’s campaign against Iran-backed Hezbollah forces in southern Lebanon and by its destruction of most of the Syrian army’s strategic weapons, said Israel would act with the United States.
“Therefore, we will act with strength, determination and sophistication. I tell you that even if it takes time, the result will be the same,” he said.
The Houthis have launched repeated attacks on international shipping in waters near Yemen since November 2023, in support of the Palestinians over Israel’s war with Hamas.

Title: Trump says it could be worth keeping TikTok in US for a little while
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 06:08:36 +0000
Content: President-elect Donald Trump indicated on Sunday that he favored allowing TikTok to keep operating in the United States for at least a little while, saying he had received billions of views on the social media platform during his presidential campaign.
Trump’s comments before a crowd of conservative supporters in Phoenix, Arizona, were one of the strongest signals yet that he opposes a potential exit of TikTok from the U.S. market.
The U.S. Senate passed a law in April requiring TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest the app, citing national security concerns.
TikTok’s owners have sought to have the law struck down, and the U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear the case. But if the court does not rule in ByteDance’s favor and no divestment occurs, the app could be effectively banned in the United States on Jan. 19, one day before Trump takes office.
It is unclear how Trump would go about undoing the TikTok divestiture order, which passed overwhelmingly in the Senate.
“I think we’re going to have to start thinking because, you know, we did go on TikTok, and we had a great response with billions of views, billions and billions of views,” Trump told the crowd at AmericaFest, an annual gathering organized by conservative group Turning Point.
“They brought me a chart, and it was a record, and it was so beautiful to see, and as I looked at it, I said, ‘Maybe we gotta keep this sucker around for a little while’,” he said.
Trump met with TikTok’s CEO on Monday. Trump said at a news conference the same day that he had a “warm spot” for TikTok thanks to his campaign’s success on the app.
The Justice Department has argued that Chinese control of TikTok poses a continuing threat to national security, a position supported by most U.S. lawmakers.
TikTok says the Justice Department has misstated the social media app’s ties to China, arguing that its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in the United States on cloud servers operated by Oracle Corp, while content moderation decisions that affect U.S. users are made in the United States.

Title: Foreign Secretary Misri reaffirms deepening of India-Mauritius ties during visit to the nation
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 05:43:04 +0000
Content: Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri concluded his first official visit to Mauritius from December 20-22, strengthening the bilateral ties between India and Mauritius. This visit followed a congratulatory phone call from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Mauritius Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam on November 11, celebrating his victory in the parliamentary elections.
The visit underlines the importance India places on its relationship with Mauritius and is part of continued high-level engagements between the two countries. It reflects India’s commitment to its “Neighbourhood First,” “Vision Sagar,” and “Africa Forward” policies, as well as its broader commitment to the Global South. Both nations reaffirmed their dedication to deepening their multi-dimensional partnership, aimed at fostering prosperity and development not only for the two countries but also for the wider Indian Ocean Region.
During his meeting with Prime Minister Ramgoolam, Foreign Secretary Misri congratulated him on his electoral success and extended an invitation from Prime Minister Modi for Ramgoolam to visit India. The two leaders discussed a wide range of bilateral issues and explored ways to strengthen the unique and close partnership between the two nations. Misri reaffirmed India’s ongoing commitment to Mauritius’ development and prosperity.
A significant moment during the visit was Misri’s trip to Aapravasi Ghat, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Mauritius that symbolizes the historic ties between India and Mauritius. Misri also visited key infrastructure projects funded by India, including the Civil Service College and an Area Health Centre in Cap Malheureux, underscoring India’s role in supporting Mauritius’ development.
In addition to meeting with Prime Minister Ramgoolam, Foreign Secretary Misri called on other high-ranking officials, including President Dharambeer Gokhool, Deputy Prime Minister Paul Berenger, and Foreign Minister Dhananjay Ramful. The Foreign Secretary also engaged with senior Mauritian leaders and officials, strengthening diplomatic ties further.

Title: Soccer-Liverpool hit Tottenham for six to cement top spot, Chelsea held
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 05:33:20 +0000
Content: Liverpool strengthened their hold on the Premier League top spot with an extraordinary 6-3 victory at battered Tottenham Hotspur after second-placed Chelsea were held to a frustrating 0-0 draw away to Everton on Sunday.
Mohamed Salah scored twice, as did Luis Diaz, while Alexis Mac Allister and Dominik Szoboszlai were also on target at bamboozled Spurs for Dutchman Arne Slot’s Liverpool side who head into Christmas four points clear.
Chelsea could have gone into first place before Liverpool’s clash in north London but failed to make it nine straight wins in all competitions as Everton dug deep to earn a point at Goodison Park.
Liverpool have 39 points from 16 games with Chelsea on 35 having played a game more. Arsenal, who won 5-1 at Crystal Palace on Saturday, have 33 points from 17 games.
Bottom club Southampton’s 0-0 draw at Fulham on Sunday means reigning champions Manchester City are now the worst performing Premier League team since the start of November after a 2-1 defeat at Aston Villa on Saturday left them down in seventh.
Manchester United suffered a humiliating 3-0 loss at home to Bournemouth on Sunday as the south coast club moved up to fifth, while Wolverhampton Wanderers won 3-0 at Leicester City in Vitor Pereira’s first game in charge.
Raining Goals
Tottenham’s last three home games in all competitions have now provided 23 goals as their wide-open style was ruthlessly punished by a razor-sharp Liverpool.
Diaz met Trent Alexander-Arnold’s beautiful cross with a diving header to open the scoring before Alexis Mac Allister nodded home from close range to double Liverpool’s lead.
James Maddison pulled one back for Spurs in the 41st minute but Dominik Szoboszlai restored the visitors’ two-goal lead before the break as he slotted past Fraser Forster following a counter-attack.
Salah’s double came in seven second-half minutes to take his league tally this season to 15 before Tottenham hit back with Dejan Kulusevski’s volley and Dominic Solanke’s effort in the 83rd that threatened to set up a frantic finale. But Diaz settled any Liverpool jitters with his second goal of the game.
Liverpool’s emphatic win means only one of the weekend’s Premier League games ended in a home victory.
“We expected that (a chaotic game), the way they play, they open the game, they enjoy their football, physically tough and mentally we always have to be in the game,” Salah, whose two assists took his total for the season to 11, told Sky Sports.
Salah is the first player to reach double figures for both goals and assists before Christmas in a Premier League season.
Maresca Happy
The closest Chelsea came to piercing Everton’s armour was a Nicolas Jackson shot against the post in the first half but while it proved a frustrating day for Enzo Maresca’s side the Italian remained upbeat.
“That was a real game,” he said. “I’m very happy because the performance of the boys was fantastic. Sometimes you have to play a different game and we’re learning to play a different game. Everton are one of the best teams in Europe in terms of clean sheets.”
The Toffees kept a fifth clean sheet in six games.
Manchester United manager Ruben Amorim said “nothing bad lasts forever” after his side’s 3-0 drubbing at Old Trafford, a defeat that came three days after they were beaten 4-3 at Tottenham Hotspur in the League Cup quarter-finals.
“We just need to work on the way we play, that’s all,” the Portuguese, whose side are in 13th place, said. “Focus on the job in the moment, not what you feel in the stadium.”
Goals by Dean Huijsen, Justin Kluivert and Antoine Semenyo put high-flying Bournemouth into the Europa League qualifying spot and means United will spend Christmas in the bottom half of the table for the first time in Premier League history.
Wolves moved up a place to 18th, two points short of the safety zone, with Goncalo Guedes, Rodrigo Gomes and Matheus Cunha all on target against Ruud van Nistelrooy’s Leicester — the perfect start for Pereira.
“I believe that we will stay in the Premier League and we will play at a better level than we saw today. Today I am happy as the team showed spirit and the spirit that Wolves supporters want to see,” said the Portuguese, who replaced Gary O’Neil.

Title: Three Khalistani terrorists who bombed Punjab Police posts killed in encounter in UP
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 05:01:23 +0000
Content: Three suspects accused of throwing a grenade at police posts in Punjab’s Gurdaspur were killed in a police encounter in Uttar Pradesh’s Pilibhit early Monday morning, a senior police officer said.
Punjab Police DGP Gaurav Yadav, while sharing details on the social media platform X, said, “In a major breakthrough against a Pak-sponsored Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF) terror module, a joint operation by UP Police and Punjab Police led to an encounter with three module members who fired at the police party.”
He added, “This terror module is involved in grenade attacks at police establishments in border areas of Punjab.”
He said that the three suspects were involved in the grenade attack on a police post in Gurdaspur.
Pilibhit Superintendent of Police (SP) Avinash Pandey reported that the gunfight occurred in the Puranpur police station area between the suspected Khalistani terrorists and a joint team of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh Police.
The injured suspects, identified as Gurvinder Singh, Virendra Singh, and Jasanpreet Singh, sustained injuries and were taken to a hospital for treatment.
Authorities recovered two AK-series rifles, two Glock pistols, and a large quantity of ammunition from the scene.
“Early this morning, a team from Punjab Police informed Puranpur police station that suspects in a grenade attack on a police post by alleged Khalistani terrorists might be hiding in the area,” SP Pandey said.
Upon receiving this information, police teams immediately launched a blockade and searched the area.
They later received a tip-off about three suspicious young men on a motorcycle, riding dangerously and carrying potentially harmful items, heading toward Pilibhit.
“Both Punjab Police and Puranpur police station staff chased the suspects. Meanwhile, Gajrola and Madhav Thanda police stations were alerted about possible escape routes,” he said.
“At a canal track near an under-construction bridge, the suspects opened fire when challenged by the police. In the retaliatory firing, all three were injured and subsequently sent to CSC Puranpur for treatment,” Pandey added.
However, they later succumbed to the injuries.
Recently, multiple explosions targeted police posts in Gurdaspur. On Thursday, a grenade was hurled at the closed Bakshiwal police post.
A day later, another explosion occurred at the closed Wadala Bangar police post, which had also recently shut down due to staff shortages.
Residents in nearby areas reported being shaken by the blasts.
At Wadala Bangar, frightened locals emerged from their homes at night only to discover the sound originated from the police station. Following the explosion, police vehicles patrolled the area throughout the night, with sirens blaring.

Title: Young mammoth remains found nearly intact in Siberian permafrost
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:59:36 +0000
Content: Researchers in Siberia are conducting tests on a juvenile mammoth whose remarkably well-preserved remains were discovered in thawing permafrost after more than 50,000 years.
The creature, resembling a small elephant with a trunk, was recovered from the Batagaika crater, a huge depression more than 80 metres (260 feet) deep which is widening as a result of climate change.
The carcass, weighing more than 110 kg (240 pounds), was brought to the surface on an improvised stretcher, said Maxim Cherpasov, head of the Lazarev Mammoth Museum Laboratory in the city of Yakutsk.
He said the mammoth was probably a little over a year old when it died, but tests would enable the scientists to confirm this more accurately. The fact that its head and trunk had survived was particularly unusual.
“As a rule, the part that thaws out first, especially the trunk, is often eaten by modern predators or birds. Here, for example, even though the forelimbs have already been eaten, the head is remarkably well preserved,” Cherpasov told Reuters.
It is the latest of a series of spectacular discoveries in the Russian permafrost. Last month, scientists in the same vast northeastern region – known as Sakha or Yakutia – showed off the 32,000-year-old remains of a tiny sabre-toothed cat cub, while earlier this year a 44,000-year-old wolf carcass was uncovered.

Title: Bangladesh requests India to return ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:47:38 +0000
Content: Bangladesh has formally requested India to send back former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India following her ousting on August 5 after a student-led movement.
The request was made through a “note verbale” to the Indian government, according to Touhid Hossain, the Foreign Affairs Adviser of Bangladesh’s Interim government, as reported by local media outlets. Hossain confirmed the submission of the note verbale, seeking the return of the 76-year-old leader.
Hasina, who had been in power for over a decade, was removed from office after weeks of student-led protests and violent clashes that resulted in over 600 deaths. In the wake of her ouster, she fled to India, and a new interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus was established in Bangladesh.
In a recent statement made on December 9, Hasina accused Yunus, the Chief Adviser to the interim government, of orchestrating the student protests that led to her removal. She described the protests as a “meticulously designed” effort to topple her administration.
Speaking at a virtual meeting of the United Kingdom Awami League, Hasina claimed that despite the demands of the protesters being met, unrest continued, implying a deeper conspiracy to remove her from power.
Hasina specifically pointed to Yunus, accusing him of being the “mastermind” behind the protests that started on July 7, 2024. She argued that the protests, which she claims were not student-initiated, were part of a well-planned strategy to remove her from office, even after her government addressed the protesters’ demands.
The ousted leader also voiced criticism against the interim government’s actions, describing it as “fascist” and accusing it of depriving the people of Bangladesh of their fundamental rights. She said, “Today, Bangladesh is going through a tough time. Under a fascist government, the people of Bangladesh have been deprived of their rights. The whole of Bangladesh is burning… Today, Bangladesh is being destroyed.”
Hasina also referenced the arrest of former ISKCON priest Chinmoy Krishna Das, who was detained on alleged sedition charges. She criticized the government for preventing Das from having legal representation, calling it a glaring example of the country’s deteriorating justice system.
“They arrested Chinmoy Krishna Das and said there couldn’t be any kind of lawyer defending him. What kind of justice is this?…This proves that Bangladesh doesn’t have law and order,” she added.

Title: Some gaps have narrowed in elusive Gaza ceasefire deal, sides say
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:34:02 +0000
Content: Gaps between Israel and Hamas over a possible Gaza ceasefire have narrowed, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials’ remarks on Monday, though crucial differences have yet to be resolved.
A fresh bid by mediators Egypt, Qatar and the United States to end the fighting and release Israeli and foreign hostages has gained momentum this month, though no breakthrough has yet been reported.
A Palestinian official familiar with the talks said while some sticking points had been resolved, the identity of some of the Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel in return for hostages had yet to be agreed, along with the precise deployment of Israeli troops in Gaza.
His remarks corresponded with comments by the Israeli diaspora minister, Amichai Chikli, who said both issues were still being negotiated. Nonetheless, he said, the sides were far closer to reaching agreement than they have been for months.
“This ceasefire can last six months or it can last 10 years, it depends on the dynamics that will form on the ground,” Chikli told Israel’s Kan radio. 
Much hinged on what powers would be running and rehabilitating Gaza once fighting stopped, he said.
The duration of the ceasefire has been a fundamental sticking point throughout several rounds of failed negotiations. Hamas wants an end to the war, while Israel wants an end to Hamas’ rule of Gaza first.
“The issue of ending the war completely hasn’t yet been resolved,” said the Palestinian official.
Israeli minister Zeev Elkin, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet, told Israel’s Army Radio that the aim was to find an agreed framework that would resolve that difference during a second stage of the ceasefire deal.
Chikli said the first stage would be a humanitarian phase that will last 42 days and include a hostage release.
Hospital

The war was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.
Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza has since killed more than 45,200 Palestinians, according to health officials in the Hamas-run enclave. 
Most of the population of 2.3 million has been displaced and much of Gaza is in ruins. At least 11 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes on Monday, medics said.
One of Gaza’s few still partially functioning hospitals, on its northern edge, an area under intense Israeli military pressure for nearly three months, sought urgent help after being hit by Israeli fire.
“We are facing a continuous daily threat,” said Hussam Abu Safiya, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital. 
“The bombing continues from all directions, affecting the building, the departments, and the staff.”
The Israeli military did not immediately comment. On Sunday it said it was supplying fuel and food to the hospital and helping evacuate some patients and staff to safer areas.
Palestinians accuse Israel of seeking to permanently depopulate northern Gaza to create a buffer zone, which Israel denies.
Israel says its operation around the three communities on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip – Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia – is targeting Hamas militants.
On Monday, the United Nations’ aid chief, Tom Fletcher, said Israeli forces had hampered efforts to deliver much needed aid in northern Gaza.
“North Gaza has been under a near-total siege for more than two months, raising the spectre of famine,” he said. 
“South Gaza is extremely overcrowded, creating horrific living conditions and even greater humanitarian needs as winter sets in.”

Title: Stock market gains nearly 500 points amid positive global cues
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:23:35 +0000
Content: After a week of losses, Indian equity markets closed on a positive note on Monday, buoyed by strong global cues. The domestic benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty, rebounded after witnessing a near 5% decline over the past five consecutive trading sessions.
Realty and PSU bank stocks led the rally in the Nifty, driving the market upwards.
At the close, the Sensex settled at 78,540.17, marking a gain of 498.58 points or 0.64%, while the Nifty ended at 23,753.45, up 165.95 points or 0.70%.
The Nifty Bank index climbed 558.40 points, or 1.10%, to close at 51,317.60. The Nifty Midcap 100 index rose by 186.15 points or 0.33%, ending at 57,092.90. However, the Nifty Smallcap 100 index declined slightly, losing 26.50 points or 0.14% to close at 18,687.80.
V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, pointed out that short-term market recoveries may continue but could face renewed pressure from Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) selling.
“In the short run, there will be market rebounds, which may be followed by renewed FII selling. A sustained rally is possible only when we see clear signs of economic growth revival, likely in early 2025,” he said.
Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, attributed the optimism to improved global data and positive sentiment in interest rate-sensitive sectors.
“The lower-than-expected US PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) data boosted investor confidence, particularly in metals, which benefited from expectations of higher steel import taxes. However, the short-term outlook remains sideways due to a lack of fresh catalysts and the impact of the festive season,” he said.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), 1,640 shares advanced, while 2,445 declined, and 133 remained unchanged.
Sectorally, most indices ended in green, with realty and PSU banks gaining the most. However, Auto, Media, and Healthcare sectors recorded minor losses.
In the Sensex pack, top gainers included ITC, Tech Mahindra, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, Titan, SBI, ICICI Bank, Adani Ports, Tata Steel, and Bharti Airtel. On the other hand, Zomato, Maruti, Nestle India, HCL Tech, and Bajaj Finserv were among the top losers.
Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) sold equities worth ₹3,597.82 crore on December 20, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) purchased equities worth ₹1,374.37 crore on the same day.
Earlier in the session, the Indian stock market jumped over 600 points amid mixed but largely positive global cues, signaling renewed optimism among investors.

Title: National Consumer Day 2024: Union Minister Pralhad Joshi to launch key initiatives to boost consumer protection
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:20:36 +0000
Content: Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution, Pralhad Joshi, will chair the National Consumer Day celebration in New Delhi on Tuesday.
This year’s theme, “Virtual Hearings & Digital Access to Consumer Justice,” aligns with efforts to enhance consumer protection in an increasingly digital world.
Key initiatives will be launched during the event to protect consumers and promote transparency across sectors.
Thirteen leading e-commerce companies, including platforms from Reliance Retail, Tata Sons, Zomato, and Swiggy, will sign a Safety Pledge, a voluntary public commitment to ensure the safety of goods sold online and uphold consumer rights.
This pledge was developed after extensive consultation with stakeholders and aims to strengthen consumer protection in e-commerce, adhering to global best practices.
New Digital Tools for Consumer Protection
The event will also witness the launch of new digital tools to safeguard consumers from deceptive online practices, including the ‘Jago Grahak Jago App,’ ‘Jagriti App,’ and ‘Jagriti Dashboard.’ These tools will help detect and report “dark patterns” in e-commerce that manipulate consumer behaviour.
The AI-powered apps and dashboard will alert users to unsafe URLs and allow consumers to report suspicious activities directly to the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA).
Additionally, the ‘e-Maap’ portal, a unified digital platform for all Legal Metrology services, will be introduced. It aims to streamline processes such as licensing and verification, reducing the compliance burden for businesses while promoting transparency and protecting consumer rights.

Title: Inflation burden eases for farm and rural labourers
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:11:43 +0000
Content: The All-India Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labourers (CPI-AL) and Rural Labourers (CPI-RL) for November this year declined to 5.35 per cent and 5.47 per cent respectively, compared to 7.37 per cent and 7.13 per cent in the same month last year, according to figures released by the Ministry of Labour and Employment on Monday.
The inflation for agricultural and rural labourers for November was also lower than the corresponding figures for October 2024 at 5.96 per cent for CPI-AL and 6.00 per cent for CPI-RL. This is the second consecutive month of slowing inflation as the figures for retail inflation in October were lower than September.
The easing of the inflation burden for both agricultural and rural labourers comes as a welcome relief for these vulnerable segments that are hit hardest by spiralling prices. It also leaves more money in their hands to buy a wider range of goods, leading to a better lifestyle.
The decline also comes in the backdrop of India’s retail price inflation based on the CPI index declining to 5.48 per cent in November as the increase in prices of food items eased during the month bringing relief to household budgets, figures released earlier this month showed.
The slowing inflation marks a reversal of the increasing trend in the previous two months when the inflation rate touched 6.21 per cent in October.
During November, a significant decline in inflation was observed in vegetables, pulses, sugar and confectionery, fruits, eggs, milk and products, spices, transport and communication subgroups, according to the official statement.
The easing in inflation is a welcome sign as it was the first time that the rate of retail inflation crossed the RBI’s upper limit of 6 per cent in October. The RBI is waiting for retail inflation to come down to 4 per cent on a durable basis before it can go in for an interest rate cut to propel growth.
The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) , in its latest monetary policy review slashed the cash reserve ratio (CRR) for banks by 0.5 per cent to make more funds available for lending to spur economic growth but kept the key policy repo rate unchanged at 6.5 per cent with an eye on inflation.
The CRR has been reduced from 4.5 per cent to 4 per cent which will infuse Rs 1.16 lakh crore into the banking system and bring down market interest rates.
The monetary policy decision maintains a delicate balance between controlling inflation and pushing up the growth rate in a slowing economy,
In his last monetary policy view, former RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said, “India’s growth story is still intact. Inflation is on the declining path, but we cannot overlook the significant risks in the outlook. This risk cannot be underestimated.”
He was optimistic about the outlook for the economy, observing that “the balance between inflation and growth is well poised.”

Title: What happens when Russian gas to Europe via Ukraine stops?
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:03:36 +0000
Content: Russian President Vladimir Putin met Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico in the Kremlin on Sunday, a rare visit by a European Union leader to Moscow as a contract allowing for Russian gas to transit through Ukraine nears expiry.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said on Thursday that Kyiv could consider continued transit of Russian gas, but only on condition that Moscow did not receive payment until after the war – a condition it was unlikely to accept. Putin said that day that it was clear there would be no new deal with Kyiv to send Russian gas through Ukraine to Europe.
Here is what happens if Russian gas transit via Ukraine is completely turned off and whom will be affected most.
HOW BIG ARE THE VOLUMES?
Russian gas supplies to Europe via Ukraine are relatively small. Russia shipped about 15 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas via Ukraine in 2023 – only 8% of peak Russian gas flows to Europe via various routes in 2018-19.
Russia spent half a century building its European gas market share, which at its peak stood at 35%.
Moscow has lost its share to rivals such as Norway, the United States and Qatar since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which spurred the EU to cut its dependence on Russian gas.
EU gas prices rallied in 2022 to record highs after the loss of Russian supplies. The rally won’t be repeated given modest volumes and a small number of customers for the remaining volumes, according to EU officials and traders.
UKRAINIAN ROUTE
The Soviet-era Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod pipeline brings gas from Siberia via the town of Sudzha – which is now under control of Ukrainian military forces – in Russia’s Kursk region. It then flows through Ukraine to Slovakia.
In Slovakia, the gas pipeline splits into branches going to the Czech Republic and Austria.
Russia’s overall gas exports via the route have held steady despite the stoppage of flows from Gazprom to Austria’s OMV in mid-November over a contractual dispute, and legal wranglings as other buyers stepped in to buy the volumes.
Austria still receives most of its gas via Ukraine, while Russia accounts for around two-thirds of Hungary’s gas imports.
Slovakia takes around 3 bcm from energy giant Gazprom per year, also about two-thirds of its needs.
The Czech Republic almost completely cut gas imports from the east last year, but began taking gas from Russia in 2024.
Most other Russian gas routes to Europe are shut including Yamal-Europe via Belarus and Nord Stream under the Baltic.
The only other operational Russian gas pipeline route to Europe is the Blue Stream and TurkStream to Turkey under the Black Sea. Turkey sends some Russian gas volumes onward to Europe including to Hungary.
WHY DOES THE UKRAINIAN ROUTE STILL WORK?
While remaining Russian gas transit volumes are small, the issue remains a dilemma for the EU. Many EU members such as France and Germany have said they will not buy Russian gas anymore but the stance of Slovakia, Hungary and Austria, which have closer ties to Moscow, challenges the EU common approach.
The countries, who still receive Russian gas, argue it is the most economic fuel and also blame neighbouring EU countries for high transit fees imposed on alternative supplies.
Ukraine still earns $0.8-$1 billion in transit fees per year from Russian gas transit.
According to Reuters calculations, Gazprom’s total pipeline gas exports to Europe via all routes in 2024 have increased to 32 bcm from 28.3 bcm in 2023, when they collapsed to the lowest level since the 1970s.
Russia could earn around $5 billion on sales via Ukraine this year based on an average Russian government gas price forecast of $339 per 1,000 cubic metres, according to Reuters calculations.
Russia’s gas pipeline export monopoly Gazprom plunged to a net loss of $7 billion in 2023, its first annual loss since 1999, because of the loss of EU gas markets.
Russia has said it would be ready to extend the transit deal but Kyiv has repeatedly said it will not do it.
Another option is for Gazprom to supply some of the gas via another route, for example via TurkStream, Bulgaria, Serbia or Hungary. However, capacity via these routes is limited.
Hungary has been keen to keep the Ukrainian route open, but said it would continue to receive Russian gas from the south, via the TurkStream pipeline on the bed of the Black Sea.
The EU and Ukraine have also asked Azerbaijan to facilitate discussions with Russia regarding the gas transit deal.
A senior source at Azeri energy company SOCAR said on Friday that Moscow and Kyiv have failed to agree on the deal brokered by Azerbaijan to continue Russian gas exports to Europe via Ukraine.

Title: Biden launches new US trade probe into legacy Chinese chips
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 10:53:11 +0000
Content: The Biden administration on Monday announced a last-minute trade investigation into Chinese-made “legacy” semiconductors that could heap more U.S. tariffs on chips from China that power everyday goods from autos to washing machines to telecoms gear.
The “Section 301” probe, launched just four weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20, will be handed over to his administration in January for completion, Biden administration officials said.
The effort could offer Trump a ready avenue to begin imposing some of the hefty, 60% tariffs that he has threatened on Chinese imports.
Departing President Joe Biden has already imposed a 50% U.S. tariff on Chinese semiconductors that starts on Jan. 1. His administration has tightened export curbs on advanced AI and memory chips and chipmaking equipment to China and also recently increased tariffs to 50% on Chinese solar wafers and polysilicon.
The U.S. Trade Representative’s office, which will conduct the new probe, said it is aimed at protecting American and other market-driven chip producers from China’s massive state-driven buildup of domestic chip supply.
U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai said that the trade agency has found evidence that Beijing is targeting the semiconductor industry for global domination, similar to its buildup in steel, aluminum, solar panels, electric vehicles and critical minerals.
“This is enabling its companies to rapidly expand capacity and to offer artificially lower priced chips that threaten to significantly harm and potentially eliminate their market-oriented competition,” she told reporters on a conference call.
Legacy chips use older, mature manufacturing processes and are found in a wide range of mass market applications. They do not include advanced chips for use in artificial intelligence applications or sophisticated microprocessors.
The Biden administration will begin accepting public comments on the probe on Jan. 6, and has planned a public hearing for March 11-12, according to a Federal Register notice on the probe. It is unclear whether Trump’s choice to lead USTR, Jamieson Greer, a trade lawyer and former USTR chief during Trump’s first administration, will be confirmed by the U.S. Senate by then.
The probe is being conducted under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the same unfair trade practices statute that Trump invoked to impose tariffs of up to 25% on some $370 billion worth of Chinese imports in 2018 and 2019, triggering a nearly three-year trade war with Beijing.
If Trump takes up the probe, it needs to be completed within a year from initiation.
DOWNSTREAM GOODS PROBED
A Biden administration official said in addition to examining the impact of the imported chips themselves, the probe would also look at their incorporation into downstream components and end-use goods for critical industries including defense, automotive products and medical devices.
It also will target China’s production of silicon carbide substrates and wafers for semiconductor fabrication.
U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said her department’s research shows two-thirds of U.S. products using chips had Chinese legacy chips in them, and half of U.S. companies did not know the origin of their chips including some in the defense industry, findings that were “fairly alarming.”
After the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the supply of semiconductors and temporarily halted production of autos and medical equipment, the U.S. has sought to build its own semiconductor supply chain with $52.7 billion in new subsidies for chip production, research and workforce development.
But Raimondo said China’s plans to build more than 60% of the world’s new legacy chip capacity over the next decade were discouraging investment elsewhere and constituted unfair competition.
It “undercuts our companies and makes the U.S. dependent on China for the chips that we use every day in so many things,” she told reporters.
Despite a bitter presidential campaign, one of the few areas of continuity between Biden’s and Trump’s administrations will be tariffs on China. Biden kept in place all of the duties on Chinese imports imposed by Trump and added to them, including 100% duties on Chinese-made electric vehicles in an effort to keep them out of the U.S. market.

Title: Gold gains 30% in 2024, silver up 35% on COMEX this year: MOFSL
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 10:45:03 +0000
Content: Gold and silver have experienced an impressive rally in 2024, gaining approximately 30% and 35%, respectively, on the Commodity Exchange (COMEX), a report revealed on Monday.
While central bank policies and geopolitical risks are significant drivers of gold and silver prices, other factors also play a role in shaping the market, according to the report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd (MOFSL).
In 2024, global demand for precious metals increased substantially. Central banks worldwide, including those in emerging markets, have been net buyers of gold for over a decade. In 2024, they collectively purchased more than 500 tonnes of gold, reflecting a strategy to diversify reserves amid economic uncertainties, the report stated.
“Looking ahead, the outlook for gold and silver remains positive, although some market consolidation or short-term dips may present buying opportunities. A loose monetary policy environment, coupled with ongoing geopolitical risks, should continue to provide a favourable backdrop for gold and silver,” said Manav Modi, Analyst, Commodity Research, MOFSL.
The growing interest from central banks has added upward pressure on prices, as these institutions accumulate gold as a hedge against the volatility of fiat currencies.
The recent resurgence in gold ETFs, which had seen outflows in previous years, indicates renewed investor interest in gold as a safe-haven asset.
“In India, domestic demand has surged, with assets under management in gold and silver ETFs surpassing Rs 30,000 crore and Rs 7,500 crore, respectively. Additionally, the reduction of import duties on gold and silver by the Indian government has spurred demand, especially during festive and wedding seasons, further driving up prices,” the report mentioned.
Overall imports for both gold and silver on the domestic front have been significant this year, totalling more than 700 tonnes and 6,000 tonnes, respectively.
“The role of central bank actions and geopolitical risks in driving gold and silver prices has been a key factor, considering the broader economic environment,” the report noted.
Central bank monetary policies are pivotal in shaping economic conditions, and recent developments from the Federal Reserve highlight this dynamic.
The US Fed’s announcement of a 50 bps rate cut indicates a proactive approach to stimulate the economy amid easing inflation and concerns regarding the labour market, the report stated.

Title: PM Modi condemns Germany market attack, advocates brotherhood at CBCI Christmas event
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 17:21:56 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday condemned attempts to incite violence in society, highlighting that the teachings of Jesus Christ promote love, harmony, and brotherhood.
While speaking at the Christmas event hosted by the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India (CBCI) at its headquarters here, PM Modi stressed the need to work together to embody the values taught by Jesus and strengthen this spirit of unity.
He also condemned last week’s terror attack at Germany’s Magdeburg Christmas Market, where an SUV drove into a crowd, resulting in the deaths of four women and a nine-year-old child, while injuring 205 people. Among the injured were seven Indians.
PM Modi stressed the importance of prioritising human interests alongside national interests, stating that India’s foreign policy reflects this approach.
He highlighted India’s humanitarian efforts during the Covid-19 pandemic, where the country helped over 150 nations by providing medicines and vaccines. This approach, centred on human welfare, had a positive global impact, with countries like Guyana and several island nations expressing deep gratitude.
“India went beyond its capabilities to help other countries during the Covid-19 pandemic, providing medicines to over 150 nations,” he said.
He also highlighted the evacuation of Indians stranded in war-torn nations, saying that no matter where they are or what crisis they face, today’s India sees it as its duty to bring its citizens to safety.
“We brought back our nurses who got stuck in the Gulf countries. It was a very satisfactory moment for me when we safely brought Father Alexis Prem Kumar from war-torn Afghanistan, a decade back. He was stuck there for 8 months and was in hostage… for us, all these missions are not mere diplomatic missions but an emotional commitment to bring back family members,” he said.
The Prime Minister further expressed pride in George Koovakad’s elevation as a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Catholic Church.
“It is a moment of pride that His Holiness Pope Francis has made His Eminence George Koovakad a Cardinal of the Holy Roman Catholic Church,” he said.
He stressed the significance of hope in transforming the world, drawing attention to India’s achievements over the past decade.
PM Modi pointed out that 250 million people have overcome poverty, and the nation’s economy has grown from the 10th to the 5th largest globally.
He praised the country’s youth for their drive and ambition, and highlighted the empowerment of women across sectors, including entrepreneurship and the armed forces, emphasising that no nation can progress without empowering women.
PM Modi also discussed India’s strides in technology, with advancements in mobile and semiconductor manufacturing. He underlined the importance of technology in empowering the poor and the rapid infrastructure development taking place, including new expressways, rural roads, and metro routes.
These initiatives, he said, inspire hope for a brighter future for India.
The Prime Minister reiterated the values of compassion and selfless service taught by Jesus Christ, stressing the role of institutions in serving society. He commended the government’s initiatives, such as the PM Awas Yojana, which empowers women by building homes in their names, and the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam, which has increased women’s participation in Parliament.
PM Modi concluded by reiterating the importance of collective effort in building a developed India.
He expressed his confidence that, with ongoing initiatives like Swachh Bharat and support for local artisans, India will continue to progress.
“A developed India is our shared goal, and together, we will achieve it,” he affirmed, wishing everyone a Merry Christmas and a hopeful Jubilee Year.

Title: NIA arrests key aide of designated Khalistani terrorist Lakhbir Singh Landa
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 16:25:10 +0000
Content: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has arrested Jatinder Singh, alias Jyoti, a key aide of designated Khalistani terrorist Lakhbir Singh Landa and gangster Bachitar Singh, also known as Pavitar Batala. The arrest marks a critical breakthrough in the Punjab terror conspiracy case.
Jatinder, a resident of Gurdaspur in Punjab, was apprehended in Mumbai following extensive on-ground and technical operations by the NIA. He had been on the run since July 2024, evading arrest after the agency captured weapons supplier Baljit Singh, alias Rana Bhai, a resident of Madhya Pradesh.
According to the NIA, Jatinder is a member of a terror gang led by Landa, who operates from abroad as part of the banned Babbar Khalsa International (BKI), and is closely linked to Batala, Landa’s associate. The investigations revealed Jatinder’s active involvement in the smuggling of arms and their delivery to on-ground operatives in Punjab.
The agency stated that Jatinder had procured ten pistols from Baljit Singh in Madhya Pradesh and transported them to Punjab to aid Landa and Batala’s network. He had also been planning to bring additional weapons from Madhya Pradesh, but the NIA’s sustained surveillance thwarted his attempts.
The NIA’s efforts have been part of a broader operation to dismantle the nexus between terror networks and gangsters. Jatinder’s arrest is seen as a step towards preventing the smuggling of weapons, ammunition, and explosives that fuel terrorist activities in India.

Title: Veteran Filmmaker Shyam Benegal passes away at 90
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 15:54:03 +0000
Content: Renowned filmmaker Shyam Benegal, a trailblazer of India’s parallel cinema movement, passed away on Monday in Mumbai at the age of 90. The legendary director had been battling a prolonged kidney ailment and was receiving treatment at Wockhardt Hospital.
His funeral is scheduled for 10:00 am on Tuesday in Mumbai.
Widely regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers of post-1970s India, Benegal’s contributions to cinema earned him numerous accolades, including 18 National Film Awards, a Nandi Award, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, Padma Shri, and Padma Bhushan. Just a few months ago, the director had celebrated his milestone 90th birthday in Mumbai.
Born in Hyderabad to Sridhar B. Benegal, a noted figure in photography, Shyam Benegal was a second cousin to celebrated filmmaker Guru Dutt. He began his creative journey as a copywriter and made his first documentary film, Gher Betha Ganga (1962), in Gujarati.
His early feature films—Ankur (1973), Nishant (1975), Manthan (1976), and Bhumika (1977)—firmly established him as a pioneer of the New Wave cinema movement in India.
From 1980 to 1986, Benegal served as the Director of the National Film Development Corporation (NFDC), where he contributed significantly to the growth of independent Indian cinema.
Benegal’s diverse storytelling style and ability to explore complex themes won him widespread acclaim. His 1983 film Mandi, a satirical take on politics and prostitution featuring Shabana Azmi and Smita Patil, remains a classic. With Trikal, based on the waning days of Portuguese rule in Goa, he delved deep into the intricacies of human relationships.
In the 1980s, amid a challenging phase for parallel cinema marked by declining funding due to the advent of VCRs, Benegal adapted to the changing landscape of Indian entertainment. He turned to television, creating the iconic series Bharat Ek Khoj, which chronicled the history of India and became a cultural milestone.

Title: Coffee and Tea may reduce risk of head and neck cancer, study finds
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 14:36:49 +0000
Content: Regular consumption of coffee and tea may help lower the risk of developing head and neck cancers, including cancers of the mouth and throat, according to a study published on Monday in the CANCER journal. These findings could hold significant implications for the global fight against one of the most prevalent forms of cancer.
Head and neck cancer is the seventh most common type of cancer worldwide, with rising rates, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The study analyzed data from 14 previous studies and included information on 9,548 patients with head and neck cancers, compared with 15,783 individuals without cancer.
The research revealed that individuals who consumed more than four cups of caffeinated coffee daily had 17% lower odds of developing head and neck cancers overall compared to non-coffee drinkers. Notably, they had a 30% lower risk of oral cavity cancer and a 22% lower risk of throat cancer.
Furthermore, consuming three to four cups of caffeinated coffee was associated with a striking 41% lower risk of hypopharyngeal cancer—a type of cancer that affects the bottom of the throat. The study also observed some protective effects of decaffeinated coffee, with a 25% lower likelihood of oral cavity cancer among those who drank it.
Tea consumption showed similar benefits but with nuances. Drinking tea was linked to a 29% reduction in the odds of developing hypopharyngeal cancer. However, while drinking one cup or less daily reduced the overall risk of head and neck cancers by 9% and hypopharyngeal cancer by 27%, consuming more than one cup daily was associated with a 38% higher likelihood of developing laryngeal cancer.
“These findings demonstrate the varying effects of coffee and tea on different sub-sites of head and neck cancer, even suggesting some benefits from decaffeinated coffee,” said senior author Yuan-Chin Amy Lee from Huntsman Cancer Institute and the University of Utah School of Medicine. Lee underscored the complexity of coffee and tea consumption habits and emphasized the need for further research to better understand their role in cancer prevention.
Participants in the study completed detailed questionnaires about their consumption of caffeinated coffee, decaffeinated coffee, and tea over varying time frames. The researchers concluded that while coffee and tea show promise in reducing cancer risks, additional studies are needed to fully explore and confirm their protective effects.
This study offers a hopeful perspective on the potential health benefits of coffee and tea, particularly in mitigating the risks associated with certain types of cancer. However, moderation and further investigation remain key to understanding their long-term impacts.

Title: EAM Jaishankar to visit US ahead of Trump’s second term
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 13:42:04 +0000
Content: External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar will embark on an official visit to the United States from December 24 to 29, according to a statement from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).
The visit comes as preparations are underway for US President-elect Donald Trump to assume office for his second term on January 20. Jaishankar’s agenda includes discussions with key counterparts on bilateral, regional, and global issues. The EAM will also chair a conference with India’s Consul Generals in the USA during his stay.
This diplomatic engagement follows a congratulatory phone call last month between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Donald Trump, during which Modi expressed eagerness to work together once again.
“Had a great conversation with my friend, President Donald Trump, congratulating him on his spectacular victory. Looking forward to working closely together to strengthen India-US relations across technology, defense, energy, space, and other sectors,” Modi wrote on X.
Trump, in turn, reportedly conveyed admiration for Modi, referring to him as a “magnificent man” and describing India as a “magnificent country.” Both leaders reiterated their shared commitment to fostering global peace and furthering the partnership between their nations.
As Modi rekindles diplomatic ties with Trump, it’s noteworthy that India-US relations also flourished during President Joe Biden’s tenure. The two leaders built strong rapport, engaging in multiple personal meetings over the past four years.
Most recently, they convened during the G20 Summit in Brazil and at Biden’s weekend retreat in Delaware. Last year, Biden made a historic visit to India for the G20 summit hosted by Modi, marking another milestone in their collaboration. Modi was also received in Washington during a state visit marked by ceremonial grandeur.
Biden said, “Each time, I was struck by our ability to find new areas of cooperation. Together, we’re unlocking a shared future of unlimited potential.”
Under Biden’s leadership, the India-US partnership expanded significantly. The two nations elevated the Quad—a strategic alliance involving Japan and Australia—to the summit level. Additionally, the I2U2 grouping comprising India, Israel, the UAE, and the US was established to promote cooperation across India’s western flank, mirroring the Quad’s objectives in the Indo-Pacific region.

Title: Nearly 10 Lakh jobs distributed under Rozgar Mela since 2022: PM Modi
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 13:15:31 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Monday that nearly 10 lakh permanent government jobs have been offered through the Rozgar Mela initiative since its inception in October 2022.
Speaking at the 14th edition of the recruitment drive, PM Modi described it as a milestone in the government’s efforts to provide transparent and fair employment opportunities.
Launched on October 22, 2022, Rozgar Mela aims to recruit 10 lakh personnel across various government ministries and departments. In its inaugural edition, appointment letters were handed over to 75,000 new recruits. Since then, the initiative has conducted 14 editions, distributing 9.25 lakh job letters.
On Monday, 71,000 new appointees received their appointment letters during ceremonies held at 45 locations across the country. The latest drive reflects the government’s commitment to creating job opportunities and addressing unemployment.
The Rozgar Mela has emerged as a platform for connecting job seekers with employers, empowering individuals to contribute to India’s development. PM Modi underscored the government’s efforts to facilitate employment and ensure transparency in the recruitment process.
In the 13th edition held on October 29, 51,000 appointment letters were distributed. On the occasion, the Prime Minister emphasized initiatives to enhance international employment prospects for Indian youth. He cited Germany’s Skilled Labour Strategy, which increased annual visas for skilled Indian workers from 20,000 to 90,000. Additionally, India has signed migration and employment agreements with 21 countries, including Japan, Australia, France, Germany, and Gulf nations.
A total of 71,000 appointees each were given letters in Rozgar Mela edition number 2, 3, 4 and 5. In the sixth (June 13) and seventh editions (July 22), 70,000 appointment letters each were distributed by the PM.

Content: Researchers in Siberia are conducting tests on a juvenile mammoth whose remarkably well-preserved remains were discovered in thawing permafrost after more than 50,000 years.
The creature, resembling a small elephant with a trunk, was recovered from the Batagaika crater, a huge depression more than 80 metres (260 feet) deep which is widening as a result of climate change.
The carcass, weighing more than 110 kg (240 pounds), was brought to the surface on an improvised stretcher, said Maxim Cherpasov, head of the Lazarev Mammoth Museum Laboratory in the city of Yakutsk.
He said the mammoth was probably a little over a year old when it died, but tests would enable the scientists to confirm this more accurately. The fact that its head and trunk had survived was particularly unusual.
“As a rule, the part that thaws out first, especially the trunk, is often eaten by modern predators or birds. Here, for example, even though the forelimbs have already been eaten, the head is remarkably well preserved,” Cherpasov told Reuters.
It is the latest of a series of spectacular discoveries in the Russian permafrost. Last month, scientists in the same vast northeastern region – known as Sakha or Yakutia – showed off the 32,000-year-old remains of a tiny sabre-toothed cat cub, while earlier this year a 44,000-year-old wolf carcass was uncovered.

Title: Bangladesh requests India to return ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:47:38 +0000
Content: Bangladesh has formally requested India to send back former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India following her ousting on August 5 after a student-led movement.
The request was made through a “note verbale” to the Indian government, according to Touhid Hossain, the Foreign Affairs Adviser of Bangladesh’s Interim government, as reported by local media outlets. Hossain confirmed the submission of the note verbale, seeking the return of the 76-year-old leader.
Hasina, who had been in power for over a decade, was removed from office after weeks of student-led protests and violent clashes that resulted in over 600 deaths. In the wake of her ouster, she fled to India, and a new interim government led by Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus was established in Bangladesh.
In a recent statement made on December 9, Hasina accused Yunus, the Chief Adviser to the interim government, of orchestrating the student protests that led to her removal. She described the protests as a “meticulously designed” effort to topple her administration.
Speaking at a virtual meeting of the United Kingdom Awami League, Hasina claimed that despite the demands of the protesters being met, unrest continued, implying a deeper conspiracy to remove her from power.
Hasina specifically pointed to Yunus, accusing him of being the “mastermind” behind the protests that started on July 7, 2024. She argued that the protests, which she claims were not student-initiated, were part of a well-planned strategy to remove her from office, even after her government addressed the protesters’ demands.
The ousted leader also voiced criticism against the interim government’s actions, describing it as “fascist” and accusing it of depriving the people of Bangladesh of their fundamental rights. She said, “Today, Bangladesh is going through a tough time. Under a fascist government, the people of Bangladesh have been deprived of their rights. The whole of Bangladesh is burning… Today, Bangladesh is being destroyed.”
Hasina also referenced the arrest of former ISKCON priest Chinmoy Krishna Das, who was detained on alleged sedition charges. She criticized the government for preventing Das from having legal representation, calling it a glaring example of the country’s deteriorating justice system.
“They arrested Chinmoy Krishna Das and said there couldn’t be any kind of lawyer defending him. What kind of justice is this?…This proves that Bangladesh doesn’t have law and order,” she added.

Title: Some gaps have narrowed in elusive Gaza ceasefire deal, sides say
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:34:02 +0000
Content: Gaps between Israel and Hamas over a possible Gaza ceasefire have narrowed, according to Israeli and Palestinian officials’ remarks on Monday, though crucial differences have yet to be resolved.
A fresh bid by mediators Egypt, Qatar and the United States to end the fighting and release Israeli and foreign hostages has gained momentum this month, though no breakthrough has yet been reported.
A Palestinian official familiar with the talks said while some sticking points had been resolved, the identity of some of the Palestinian prisoners to be released by Israel in return for hostages had yet to be agreed, along with the precise deployment of Israeli troops in Gaza.
His remarks corresponded with comments by the Israeli diaspora minister, Amichai Chikli, who said both issues were still being negotiated. Nonetheless, he said, the sides were far closer to reaching agreement than they have been for months.
“This ceasefire can last six months or it can last 10 years, it depends on the dynamics that will form on the ground,” Chikli told Israel’s Kan radio. 
Much hinged on what powers would be running and rehabilitating Gaza once fighting stopped, he said.
The duration of the ceasefire has been a fundamental sticking point throughout several rounds of failed negotiations. Hamas wants an end to the war, while Israel wants an end to Hamas’ rule of Gaza first.
“The issue of ending the war completely hasn’t yet been resolved,” said the Palestinian official.
Israeli minister Zeev Elkin, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s security cabinet, told Israel’s Army Radio that the aim was to find an agreed framework that would resolve that difference during a second stage of the ceasefire deal.
Chikli said the first stage would be a humanitarian phase that will last 42 days and include a hostage release.
Hospital

The war was triggered by Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.
Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza has since killed more than 45,200 Palestinians, according to health officials in the Hamas-run enclave. 
Most of the population of 2.3 million has been displaced and much of Gaza is in ruins. At least 11 Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes on Monday, medics said.
One of Gaza’s few still partially functioning hospitals, on its northern edge, an area under intense Israeli military pressure for nearly three months, sought urgent help after being hit by Israeli fire.
“We are facing a continuous daily threat,” said Hussam Abu Safiya, director of the Kamal Adwan Hospital. 
“The bombing continues from all directions, affecting the building, the departments, and the staff.”
The Israeli military did not immediately comment. On Sunday it said it was supplying fuel and food to the hospital and helping evacuate some patients and staff to safer areas.
Palestinians accuse Israel of seeking to permanently depopulate northern Gaza to create a buffer zone, which Israel denies.
Israel says its operation around the three communities on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip – Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia – is targeting Hamas militants.
On Monday, the United Nations’ aid chief, Tom Fletcher, said Israeli forces had hampered efforts to deliver much needed aid in northern Gaza.
“North Gaza has been under a near-total siege for more than two months, raising the spectre of famine,” he said. 
“South Gaza is extremely overcrowded, creating horrific living conditions and even greater humanitarian needs as winter sets in.”

Title: Stock market gains nearly 500 points amid positive global cues
Publication Date: Mon, 23 Dec 2024 11:23:35 +0000
Content: After a week of losses, Indian equity markets closed on a positive note on Monday, buoyed by strong global cues. The domestic benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty, rebounded after witnessing a near 5% decline over the past five consecutive trading sessions.
Realty and PSU bank stocks led the rally in the Nifty, driving the market upwards.
At the close, the Sensex settled at 78,540.17, marking a gain of 498.58 points or 0.64%, while the Nifty ended at 23,753.45, up 165.95 points or 0.70%.
The Nifty Bank index climbed 558.40 points, or 1.10%, to close at 51,317.60. The Nifty Midcap 100 index rose by 186.15 points or 0.33%, ending at 57,092.90. However, the Nifty Smallcap 100 index declined slightly, losing 26.50 points or 0.14% to close at 18,687.80.
V.K. Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, pointed out that short-term market recoveries may continue but could face renewed pressure from Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) selling.
“In the short run, there will be market rebounds, which may be followed by renewed FII selling. A sustained rally is possible only when we see clear signs of economic growth revival, likely in early 2025,” he said.
Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, attributed the optimism to improved global data and positive sentiment in interest rate-sensitive sectors.
“The lower-than-expected US PCE (Personal Consumption Expenditures) data boosted investor confidence, particularly in metals, which benefited from expectations of higher steel import taxes. However, the short-term outlook remains sideways due to a lack of fresh catalysts and the impact of the festive season,” he said.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), 1,640 shares advanced, while 2,445 declined, and 133 remained unchanged.
Sectorally, most indices ended in green, with realty and PSU banks gaining the most. However, Auto, Media, and Healthcare sectors recorded minor losses.
In the Sensex pack, top gainers included ITC, Tech Mahindra, HDFC Bank, IndusInd Bank, Titan, SBI, ICICI Bank, Adani Ports, Tata Steel, and Bharti Airtel. On the other hand, Zomato, Maruti, Nestle India, HCL Tech, and Bajaj Finserv were among the top losers.
Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) sold equities worth ₹3,597.82 crore on December 20, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) purchased equities worth ₹1,374.37 crore on the same day.
Earlier in the session, the Indian stock market jumped over 600 points amid mixed but largely positive global cues, signaling renewed optimism among investors.
