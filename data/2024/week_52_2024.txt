Title: Students wanted to postpone exams, sent bomb threats to their own schools: Delhi Police
Publication Date: Sun, 22 Dec 2024 10:12:52 +0000
Content: The Delhi Police revealed on Sunday that bomb threat emails sent to two schools in Rohini were sent by their own students. According to the police, the students sent the emails in an attempt to postpone their exams as they were unprepared.
“After an investigation by the Special Cell of Delhi Police, it was found that the emails were sent by two different students from the same school. Both students admitted to sending the emails to avoid their exams,” a Delhi Police official said.
“Since both were minors, they were counselled and released,” the police added.
On December 14, the Delhi Police Special Cell identified a student from a private school as the sender of a bomb threat email to a school in Paschim Vihar. Upon tracing the IP address, the police located the student’s home. During questioning, the student confessed to the act and was subsequently counselled. The police issued a warning to his parents to monitor his behaviour.
Between December 13 and 17, several schools in Delhi received bomb threat emails, with a total of 30 schools being targeted with hoax threats on December 13 alone.
On November 19, the Delhi High Court directed the Delhi government and police to devise a comprehensive action plan, including a detailed Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), to handle bomb threats and related emergencies. The court set an eight-week deadline for implementing these measures.

Title: AI reveals hidden hazards of chemical mixtures in rivers: Study
Publication Date: Sun, 22 Dec 2024 10:11:50 +0000
Content: Artificial intelligence can provide significant insights into how complex chemical mixtures in rivers affect aquatic life, paving the way for more effective environmental protection.
A novel methodology developed by academics at the University of Birmingham demonstrates how advanced artificial intelligence (AI) approaches can help identify potentially harmful chemicals in rivers by monitoring their effects on small water fleas (Daphnia).
The team collaborated with scientists from the Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences (RCEES) in China and the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) in Germany to analyze water samples from the Chaobai River system near Beijing. This river system is exposed to chemical pollutants from various sources, including agriculture, domestic use, and industry.
Professor John Colbourne, director of the University of Birmingham’s Centre for Environmental Research and Justice and a senior author of the paper, expressed optimism about the technology’s potential. He said:
“There is a vast array of chemicals in the environment. Water safety cannot be assessed one substance at a time. Now we have the means to monitor the totality of chemicals in environmental water samples to uncover unknown substances acting together to produce toxicity to animals, including humans.”
The results, published in Environmental Science and Technology, reveal that certain chemical mixtures can interact to impact critical biological processes in aquatic organisms, as indicated by changes in their genes. These chemical combinations create environmental hazards potentially greater than those posed by individual substances.
The research team used water fleas (Daphnia) as test organisms due to their sensitivity to water quality changes and their genetic similarities with other species, making them excellent indicators of environmental hazards.
“Our innovative approach leverages Daphnia as a sentinel species to uncover potential toxic substances in the environment,” explained Dr. Xiaojing Li of the University of Birmingham and the study’s lead author.
“By using AI methods, we can identify which subsets of chemicals might be particularly harmful to aquatic life, even at low concentrations that wouldn’t normally raise concerns.”
Dr. Jiarui Zhou, also at the University of Birmingham and co-first author, led the development of the AI algorithms. He said:
“Our approach demonstrates how advanced computational methods can help solve pressing environmental challenges. By analyzing vast amounts of biological and chemical data simultaneously, we can better understand and predict environmental risks.”
Professor Luisa Orsini, another senior author, emphasized the innovation in their methodology:
“The study’s key breakthrough lies in our data-driven, unbiased approach to uncovering how environmentally relevant concentrations of chemical mixtures can cause harm. This challenges conventional ecotoxicology and paves the way for regulatory adoption of the sentinel species Daphnia, alongside new methodological approaches.”
Dr. Timothy Williams, a co-author from the University of Birmingham, noted:
“Typically, aquatic toxicology studies either use high concentrations of individual chemicals to determine detailed biological responses or only measure apical effects, such as mortality and altered reproduction, after exposure to an environmental sample. This study breaks new ground by identifying key classes of chemicals affecting living organisms within genuine environmental mixtures at relatively low concentrations, while simultaneously characterizing the biomolecular changes they elicit.”

Title: Suspect in German Christmas market attack held on murder charges after night of grief, scuffles
Publication Date: Sun, 22 Dec 2024 10:06:19 +0000
Content: A man suspected of driving a car into a German Christmas market in an attack that killed at least five people and injured scores of others faces charges of murder and attempted murder, police said on Sunday, after the man was remanded in custody.
Police in the central city of Magdeburg where the attack happened on Friday also reported scuffles at a far-right demonstration attended by around 2,100 people on Saturday night, while other residents took part in sombre remembrance events.
The suspect is a 50-year-old man from Saudi Arabia who has lived in Germany for almost two decades.
A magistrate ordered the man, identified in German media as Taleb A., into pretrial custody after prosecutors pressed charges of murder on five counts, multiple counts of attempted murder and grievous bodily harm, according to a police statement.
It identified the dead as a nine-year-old boy and four adult women, aged 52, 45, 75 and 67.
German authorities have not named the suspect, who has permanent resident status in Germany, and media reports do not give his full name in keeping with local privacy laws.
Police reported scuffles at a protest attended by around 2,100 people on Saturday night, one day after the attack. Right-wingers had billed the gathering on messaging app Telegram as a “demonstration against terror”.
Protesters wearing black balaclavas could be seen holding a large banner with the word ‘remigration’, a term popular with far-right supporters seeking the mass deportation of migrants and people deemed not ethnically German.
The motive in Friday night’s attack remains unclear. Investigators are probing the suspect’s criticism of German authorities’ treatment of Saudi refugees, among other things. He was also a staunch critic of Islam and had voiced support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party on social media platform X.

Title: India’s forest cover increases by 1,445 square km, ISFR 2023 shows
Publication Date: Sun, 22 Dec 2024 09:04:48 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Bhupender Yadav, on Saturday released the ‘India State of Forest Report 2023’ (ISFR 2023) at the Forest Research Institute in Dehradun. This report, published biennially by the Forest Survey of India (FSI) since 1987, offers a comprehensive assessment of India’s forest and tree resources, based on satellite data and field-based surveys. The 2023 report marks the 18th edition of this significant publication.
The ISFR 2023 provides crucial information on the country’s forest cover, tree cover, mangrove cover, growing stock, carbon stock, and instances of forest fires. It also highlights the role of agroforestry in India. According to the latest assessment, the total forest and tree cover in India stands at 827,357 square kilometers, representing 25.17 percent of the country’s total geographical area. Of this, 715,343 square kilometers (21.76%) is classified as forest cover, while 112,014 square kilometers (3.41%) is tree cover.
Yadav expressed satisfaction over the increase in the country’s forest and tree cover, which has grown by 1,445 square kilometers since the 2021 assessment. This includes an increase of 156 square kilometers in forest cover and 1,289 square kilometers in tree cover. He also emphasized the advanced technology used by FSI for real-time fire alerts and forest fire services, which help in better forest management.
In terms of the top-performing states, Chhattisgarh led with an increase of 684 square kilometers in forest and tree cover, followed by Uttar Pradesh and Odisha, each with a 559 square kilometer increase, and Rajasthan, with a 394 square kilometer increase. Mizoram, Gujarat, and Odisha were the top three states showing the largest increase in forest cover, with Mizoram seeing an increase of 242 square kilometers, followed by Gujarat (180 square kilometers) and Odisha (152 square kilometers).
The report also provides a state-wise analysis of forest and tree cover, with Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, and Maharashtra leading in total area covered by forests and trees. Madhya Pradesh alone accounts for 85,724 square kilometers of forest and tree cover, while Arunachal Pradesh and Maharashtra follow with 67,083 and 65,383 square kilometers, respectively. In terms of forest cover relative to total geographical area, Lakshadweep (91.33%) has the highest percentage, followed by Mizoram (85.34%) and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands (81.62%).
The assessment also reveals that 19 states and union territories have more than 33 percent of their geographical area under forest cover, with eight states—Mizoram, Lakshadweep, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Manipur—boasting forest cover exceeding 75 percent.
In terms of other environmental resources, India’s mangrove cover is estimated at 4,992 square kilometers. The growing stock, which includes timber and other forest products, has increased by 262 million cubic meters compared to the previous assessment. Bamboo-bearing areas have also seen growth, with an increase of 5,227 square kilometers, reaching a total of 154,670 square kilometers. The potential annual timber production from trees outside forests has been estimated at 91.51 million cubic meters.
The carbon stock in India’s forests is another key highlight of the report. The current estimate stands at 7,285.5 million tonnes, marking an increase of 81.5 million tonnes from the last assessment. Furthermore, the report shows that India has already exceeded its carbon sequestration target under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), with a carbon stock of 30.43 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent, surpassing the 2.29 billion tonnes of additional carbon sink goal set for 2030.
The ISFR 2023 not only offers valuable insights into the health of India’s forests but also serves as a vital resource for policymakers, environmental planners, state forest departments, research organizations, and academic institutions. It provides essential data that aids in the conservation and sustainable management of the country’s natural resources.

Title: Atletico go top as late Sorloth goal earns dramatic 2-1 win at Barcelona
Publication Date: Sun, 22 Dec 2024 05:08:37 +0000
Content: Alexander Sorloth struck deep in stoppage time to hand Atletico Madrid a 2-1 comeback win at Barcelona on Saturday that moved them top of LaLiga with their 12th consecutive victory across all competitions.
Pedri put the hosts ahead in the first half but Rodrigo De Paul levelled after the break before Sorloth inflicted a third straight home league defeat on Barca and knocked them off the LaLiga summit.
It was Atletico’s first away win at Barcelona in 18 years and they now have 41 points with a game in hand, three ahead of the Catalans who have gone three league games without a win.
“It’s very tough. We had chances to seal the win. If you don’t put the game to bed, this happens,” Pedri told Movistar.
“Our home is where it has to be difficult to beat us. We have to improve a lot. We have to reset ourselves mentally and physically.”
Barca were the better side in the opening exchanges and Pedri scored on the half-hour mark following a great run into the box and a one-two with Gavi, beating goalkeeper Jan Oblak with a low shot.
Despite their dominance, the hosts were unable to extend their lead after the break as Raphinha’s chip hit the crossbar and Oblak blocked Fermin Lopez’s close-range shot with his feet.
Robert Lewandowski also failed to find the net as his poor shot from inside the six-yard box was also saved by Oblak.
De Paul then grabbed the equaliser in the 60th minute, capitalising on a poor clearance by Marc Casado on the edge of the box to slot his shot into the bottom corner with what was only Atletico’s second attempt on goal in the game.
“When you suffer more, you enjoy it more. We were up against a great rival. It had been many years since Atletico had won here, and we were also playing for the top spot,” De Paul said.
“It’s exciting to be leaders. It’s a huge satisfaction. When your work pays off, you feel completely satisfied. It’s an honour to wear this shirt, and when things go well it gives me great joy.”
Oblak pulled off a couple of key saves to deny Raphinha and Pedri before substitute Sorloth netted with a first-time effort six minutes into stoppage time from a deep cross by Nahuel Molina.
“I hadn’t won in Barcelona since I arrived, finally. It was difficult, but we got three points. Let’s continue in this vein,” Oblak said.
“We started badly, with some fear that nobody understands, because we are in very good shape. After the 1-0 we were able to hold on without conceding the second.
“The league is very long. Today is not key, it’s three points and there are a lot of points left. A month and a half ago we were far away and now we are here.”
