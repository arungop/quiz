Title: Battle over curbing plastic output jeopardises UN treaty hopes
Publication Date: Sun, 01 Dec 2024 11:30:00 +0000
Content: Doubts rose on sealing a global treaty to curb plastic pollution on the last day of scheduled talks, as over 100 countries pushed to cap production while a handful of oil-producing countries wanted to focus only on plastic waste.
The fifth and final U.N. Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee meeting to yield a legally binding global treaty was set to wrap up in Busan, South Korea, on Sunday, but a final plenary session had not been held as of 4:00 p.m. (0700 GMT).
A treaty could be the most significant deal relating to environmental protection as well as climate-warming emissions since the 2015 Paris Agreement.
Countries remained far apart on Sunday on the basic scope of the treaty. An option proposed by Panama, backed by over 100 countries, would create a path for a global plastic production reduction target, while another proposal did not include production caps.
The fault line was apparent in a revised document released on Sunday by the chair of the meeting, Luis Vayas Valdivieso, which could form the basis of a treaty but remained riddled with many options on the most divisive issues: capping plastic production, managing plastic products and chemicals of concern, and financing to help developing countries implement the treaty.
Some negotiators and environmental groups observing the talks expressed profound disappointment.
“If you’re calling for a high, ambitious treaty, it means that (it’s) calling for obligations, commitments on the part of all parties,” said Dr. Sam Adu-Kumi, Lead Negotiator for Ghana.
If there was no such ambitious treaty, “it means that we have to go and come back another time, not Busan but maybe somewhere else,” Dr. Adu-Kumi told Reuters.
A smaller number of petrochemical-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia have strongly opposed efforts to target plastic production and have tried to use procedural tactics to delay negotiations.
Saudi Arabia did not have an immediate comment.
China, the United States, India, South Korea and Saudi Arabia were the top five primary polymer producing nations in 2023, according to data provider Eunomia.
“If you’re not contributing constructively, and if you’re not trying to join us in having an ambitious treaty… then please get out,” Fiji’s chief negotiator, Climate Minister Sivendra Michael, told a press conference.
HOURS REMAINING
With just hours remaining for scheduled talks and consensus seemingly out of reach, some negotiators and observers openly talked about what could happen next if negotiations collapsed or were extended to another session.
Even if a legally-binding treaty is not reached at Busan, “this is a multilateral process that can keep working towards that goal,” Mexico’s head of delegation, Camila Zepeda, told Reuters.
“We have … a coalition of the willing, over a hundred countries that want this, and we can start working together” on a way forward.
Some negotiators said a few countries were holding the proceedings hostage, avoiding compromises needed by using the U.N.’s consensus process, whereby all member states agree to adopt a text without a vote.
Senegal’s National Delegate Cheikh Ndiaye Sylla called it “a big mistake” to exclude voting during the entire negotiations, an agreement made last year during the second round of talks in Paris.
Plastic production is on track to triple by 2050, and microplastics have been found in air, fresh produce and even human breast milk.
Chemicals of concern in plastics include more than 3,200 found according to a 2023 U.N. Environment Programme report, which said women and children were particularly susceptible to their toxicity.
“If it (the text) does not have the provisions of what we expect from an ambitious treaty, then we will … go back to the same process pushing for an ambitious treaty,” Sivendra said.
“Nobody is going to leave Busan with a weak treaty.”

Title: Former Australia Test opener Ian Redpath passes away at 83
Publication Date: Sun, 01 Dec 2024 11:25:45 +0000
Content: Former Australia Test opener Ian Redpath has passed away at the age of 83, said Cricket Australia (CA) on Sunday. Redpath was a regular fixture in the Australian team in the 1960s and 1970s, and served as a member of the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame.
Hailing from Geelong, Redpath played 66 Tests and made 4737 runs at an average of 43.45, including eight centuries and 31 half centuries with a top score of 171. He took 83 catches mostly in the slips where he excelled.
He made his Test debut at the MCG in the second game of the 1963-64 series against South Africa and contributed 97 to an opening partnership of 219 with fellow Victorian Bill Lawry. Redpath’s maiden Test century, 132 against the West Indies at the SCG, did not come until 1969.
But his patience and endurance had already become a trusted bulwark to some of the more flamboyant members of the Australian line-up. His seniority and leadership was acknowledged when he was made vice-captain to Ian Chappell of the Australian team for the home series against England in 1974-75 and to Greg Chappell for the series against the West Indies in 1975-76.
“Ian was a much loved and revered figure and everyone in Australian Cricket will be enormously saddened by his passing. As a fine opening batter, Ian was a mainstay of the national team through one of the great eras of Australian cricket and beloved by many throughout the world for his courage, impeccable sportsmanship and wry humour.”
“We were privileged to hear Ian speak of the wonderful experiences and relationships cricket had provided upon his induction into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2023 and this deep love of the game was manifest in his enormous contribution to cricket at first-class and community level. The thoughts of everyone at Cricket Australia are with Ian’s family and many friends at this sad time,” said CA Chairman Mike Baird.
In first-class cricket, Redpath went on to make 14,993 runs for Victoria at an average of 41.99 with 32 centuries and 84 fifties in 226 first class matches. Redpath remained an active contributor to first-class and community cricket serving as Victorian men’s coach and in various voluntary roles in his home city, particularly with the Geelong Cricket Club.
In 1975, Redpath, who also played five ODIs for Australia, was made a Member of the Civil Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for services to cricket. He once emerged from international retirement to join World Series Cricket where injury restricted his on-field contributions, and returned to retirement.

Title: Argentina HIV patients, medics fear impact of Milei’s spending cuts
Publication Date: Sun, 01 Dec 2024 11:13:28 +0000
Content: Argentines living with HIV/AIDS and medics say spending cuts under libertarian President Javier Milei are hurting treatment of the illness and could lead to more cases, with fewer condoms for prevention and fewer tests to catch the virus early.
The right-wing leader is pushing a major austerity drive, touting his “chainsaw” to cut back the size of the state and overturn a deep fiscal deficit he inherited. That has seen budgets frozen or capped for many public sector services.
The budget for free HIV/AIDS treatment, where Argentina is a regional pioneer, fell 67% in real terms in 2024 and is set to fall 46% in 2025. That has put strain on supply of key medicines and could leave thousands without care next year, experts said.
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Most people with HIV can live near-normal lives and not suffer from AIDS-related illness with effective early treatment.
“I’ve been taking expired medication since May. Now in October they gave me medication until February, which expired in November,” Claudio Mariani, 59, who was initially diagnosed as HIV positive in 1993, told Reuters.
“In my case, for example, I’m doing the viral load test now but I don’t know when I’ll have the results,” he added.
According to official government data there are around 140,000 people living with HIV in Argentina. Around half that number depend on public sector treatment, according to the Health Ministry’s latest Epidemiological Bulletin.
The government did not respond to requests for comment.
The Huésped Foundation, which works to ensure access to care for HIV/AIDS sufferers, said more than 9,000 people would see treatment interrupted in 2025 due to the spending cuts.
The government’s draft budget would see spending on the free HIV treatment service “Program 22” rise from 21 billion to 23 billion pesos ($23 million), which with inflation at likely over 100% means a significant real-terms spending cut.
This could see patients not being diagnosed or being caught late, ironically pushing up hospital costs, experts said.
“These people require hospitalization, treatment for infections and a range of medical care that could be avoided if diagnosis is made earlier,” explained Leandro Cahn, executive director of the Huésped Foundation.
“All these cuts, far from saving money… generate more costs,” he said.
Ministry of Health data show that already this year the number of condoms distributed by the government fell to 209,328 from 503,460 the previous year, with expected drops in the supply of reagents and rapid tests likely to hinder care.
“Treatment is something permanent,” local HIV specialist Luis Trombetta told Reuters, explaining that this consistency kept down the mortality rate. “It cannot be replaced or interrupted.”

Title: Israeli strikes kill 15 in Gaza, Cairo holds fresh talks with Hamas
Publication Date: Sun, 01 Dec 2024 10:34:41 +0000
Content: Israeli military strikes killed at least 15 Palestinians in Gaza on Sunday, medics said, as Israeli forces kept up bombardments across the enclave and blew up houses on its northern edge.
In the central Gaza camp of Nuseirat, an Israeli airstrike killed six people in a house, and another attack killed three in a home in Gaza City, medics said.
Two children were killed when a missile hit a tent encampment in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, while four other people were killed in an airstrike in Rafah, near the border with Egypt, medics told Reuters.
Residents said the military blew up clusters of houses in the northern Gaza areas of Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, where Israeli forces have operated since October this year.
Palestinians say Israel’s operations on the northern edge of the enclave are part of a plan to clear people out through forced evacuations and bombardments to create a buffer zone – an allegation the army denies.
The military says it has killed hundreds of Hamas militants there as it fights to stop the faction regrouping almost 14 months since the war in Gaza started. Hamas’s armed wing says it has killed many Israeli forces in anti-tank rocket and mortar fire attacks, and in ambushes with explosive devices since the new operation started.
PRISONERS, TALKS
Two Palestinian detainees from Gaza have died in Israeli custody, prisoner advocacy groups said on Sunday, bringing the number of detainees reported killed since the start of the war to 47.
They named the two men as Mohammad Idris and Muath Rayyan, both in their 30s.
The Israel Prison Service said the cases were not under its jurisdiction and there was no immediate comment from the military which runs detention camps.
Israel has denied accusations from Palestinian and international human rights organizations that detainees have been mistreated and tortured in its jails and detention camps.
Meanwhile, Hamas leaders held talks in Cairo with Egyptian security officials to explore ways to reach a deal with Israel that could secure the release of hostages in return for Palestinian prisoners.
The visit was the first since the United States announced on Wednesday it would revive efforts in collaboration with Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza.
Hamas is seeking an agreement that would end the war while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the war will only end when Hamas is eradicated.
Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 44,300 people and displaced nearly all of the enclave’s population, Gaza officials say. Vast swathes of Gaza lie in ruins.
The conflict when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and abducting more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli officials.

Praying for Nagaland’s continuous progress in the times to come,” PM Modi posted on X.
Union Home Minister Amit Shah also extended greetings on Nagaland Day and said that Nagaland is blessed with a glorious culture and heritage.
“Warm greetings to our Naga sisters and brothers on Nagaland Day. Blessed with a glorious culture and heritage, Nagaland is a shining example of our diversity on Bharat’s rich cultural tapestry. I pray to God for the state to prosper under the leadership of Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio Ji,” Amit Shah posted on X.
BJP chief JP Nadda said that Nagaland is blessed with a mesmerizing landscape, rich traditions, and a deep cultural heritage.
“On Nagaland’s Statehood Day, I extend my warmest greetings to all my brothers and sisters of this vibrant state. Renowned as the ‘Land of Festivals,’ the state is blessed with a mesmerizing landscape, rich traditions, and a deep cultural heritage. May Nagaland continue to scale new heights of development, and may its people be blessed with good health and prosperity,” JP Nadda posted on X.
In 1957, Naga leaders and the central government reached an agreement to create a separate region of the Naga Hills. The State of Nagaland Act, 1962, was enacted by the Parliament to give Nagaland statehood.
It was formally recognized as a separate state on December 1, 1963, with Kohima being declared its capital.

Title: Australia PM Albanese says Musk pushing agenda for X in social media ban criticism
Publication Date: Sun, 01 Dec 2024 08:08:01 +0000
Content: Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday that criticism by Elon Musk of Australia’s social media ban on children under 16 was the X owner pushing an agenda for the social platform, while indicating he was open to talk to the billionaire about the ban, legislated this week.
Australia approved the social media ban for children late on Thursday after an emotive debate that has gripped the nation, setting a benchmark for jurisdictions around the world with one of the toughest regulations targeting Big Tech.
The ban, which the centre-left government says is world-leading, could strain Australia’s relationship with key ally the United States, where Musk, a central figure in the administration of president-elect Donald Trump, said in a post this month it seemed a “backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians”.
Albanese, asked on Sunday if he was prepared to talk to Musk about the social media ban said: “We’ll talk to anyone”.
“With regard to Elon Musk, he has an agenda, he’s entitled to push that as the owner of X, formerly known as Twitter,” Albanese added in remarks on Australian Broadcasting Corp. television.
The law forces tech giants from Instagram and Facebook owner Meta, to TikTok to stop minors logging in or face fines of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million). A trial of enforcement methods starts in January with the ban to take effect in a year.
“We are determined to get this done, the parliament has overwhelmingly passed this legislation,” Albanese told the broadcaster.
Albanese’s Labor party won crucial support from the opposition conservatives for the bill that was fast-tracked through the country’s parliament as part of 31 bills pushed through in a chaotic final day of parliament for the year.

Title: Trump threatens 100 per cent tariffs against BRICS countries if they develop own currency
Publication Date: Sun, 01 Dec 2024 06:10:37 +0000
Content: US President-Elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose 100 per cent tariffs on BRICS countries if they develop a new currency or adopt another to replace “the mighty dollar” and effectively bar them from American markets.
“There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the US Dollar in International Trade, and any country that tries should wave goodbye to America,” he posted on Truth Social on Saturday.
Threatening to close the US market to India and the other eight members of BRICS, he wrote with misplaced capitalisation of words in his style, “We require a commitment from these countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty US Dollar or, they will face 100 per cent Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US Economy.”
Trump’s warning to BRICS — after threatening higher tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada — is premature.
External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar has already categorically ruled out the idea of a common BRICS currency.
“There is no idea of a BRICS currency. Currencies will remain a national issue for a long time to come,” he said last year ahead of the group’s summit in Johannesburg.
India is the second-biggest economy in BRICS.
Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, nevertheless, went on to propose a common currency at the Johannesburg summit, but it has made no headway.
During his campaign, Trump had asserted that the dollar faced threats to its future as the world’s premier trading currency and said that President Joe Biden was ignoring it.
“The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is over,” he said in Truth Social post.
His warning to BRICS countries is more like a loyalty test to see which countries would publicly take the stand India already has and a pre-emptive warning to Beijing.
BRICS, an acronym from the names of its first set of members — Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — expanded this year to include Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Several other countries have applied to join BRICS, which is making headway as an economy-focused organisation of the Global South.
With members in a wide range of stages of economic development and types of economies, creating a common currency would be difficult.
Accepting the currency of one member as the group’s trading currency would be impossible.
China, which is the largest economy and the biggest trading country in the group, would tend to dominate with its yuan, which India and some of the other countries will resist.
The US-led sanctions on countries like Russia and Iran helped grow some bilateral trade in non-dollar currencies.
Fueled in part by US sanctions against Russia, India has paid for its oil imports from Russia with a mix of rupees and UAE dirham.
An Indian oil importer initially made some payments in yuan, and although Russia reportedly wanted payments in the Chinese currency, the Indian government has banned it, illustrating the difficulty of adopting a BRICS currency.
The European Union has the euro, but it is for a unified economic unit –which BRICS is not and cannot be — and most of their external trade is pegged to the dollar.
In addition to being the preferred currency for trade, the dollar is the main currency in which countries hold their reserves.
According to an International Monetary Fund publication in June, the dollar continues to have an “outsized role” in the world economy, but there has been an “ongoing gradual decline in the dollar’s share of allocated foreign reserves of central banks and governments.”
Now, about 60 per cent of the reserves are in dollars.
This relates to its role as the world currency reserve, and the decline is due to “fragmentations” and reserves being parked in currencies like the yuan, South Korean won, and the dollars of Singapore, Canada, and Australia.

Publication Date: Sun, 01 Dec 2024 05:13:03 +0000
Content: In Bangladesh, the interim government has failed to tackle the country’s law and order situation, business leaders said on Saturday.  It will be difficult to maintain the economy if the situation does not improve soon, they expressed concerns at a business conference organised by the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI) at a hotel in Dhaka, writes the Business Standard (TBS), a leading business daily of Bangladesh.
The government is trying to rebuild the institutions which were destroyed over the years, Selim RF Hossain, managing director of Brac Bank, said on the occasion. However, he stated that the government has failed to handle the law and order situation.
Hossain called on the government to fix the situation promptly. He warned that otherwise, it would be very, very difficult to pick up the economy, writes TBS.
Speaking at the programme, Incepta Pharmaceuticals Chairman Abdul Muktadir Rahman said, “The law and order situation has declined sharply. Nothing can be more important than this now.” He called on the government to fix a timeline to fix the situation, writes TBS.
“To reduce business costs and sustain industrial productivity the government must ensure uninterrupted gas and electricity supply while improving law enforcement,” said DCCI President Ashraf Ahmed. He also called for tax administration reforms, business process automation, and lower interest rates to support the private sector, especially small and medium enterprises, reports United News of Bangladesh (UNB).

Title: 124 killed in sectarian violence in Pakistan
Publication Date: Sun, 01 Dec 2024 05:10:20 +0000
Content: The death toll of sectarian violence in Kurram district of Pakistan’s northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province rose to 124, local administration said.
An official from the local administration of the district on Saturday said that the death toll rose after 16 more people died in armed clashes during the last 24 hours, adding that over 170 others were also injured, Xinhua news agency reported.
The majority of the injured are admitted to different hospitals including those who are in critical condition, added the official.
The violence started after armed men attacked a convoy of passenger vehicles coming from the Parachinar area in the Mandori Uchit area of the district on November 21, killing 52 people, including children and women.
The incident triggered armed clashes and attacks between two groups, including Shiite and Sunni Muslims, according to the official.
The tense situation and closure of the main highway have led to severe shortages of food, fuel, and medicine, as well as suspension of internet and mobile services, besides affecting daily life in the region as fear had gripped the population.
A high-level delegation of the provincial government visited the district after the attack on passenger coaches and held meetings with elders, leading to a ceasefire agreement, but clashes could not be stopped.
Deputy Commissioner of Kurram Javedullah Mehsud told media that efforts are being made to ensure a ceasefire by involving elders from both sides to announce a ceasefire after both sides refused to pay heed to the ceasefire arranged by the government delegation.
