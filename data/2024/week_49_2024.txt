Title: Battle over curbing plastic output jeopardises UN treaty hopes
Publication Date: Sun, 01 Dec 2024 11:30:00 +0000
Content: Doubts rose on sealing a global treaty to curb plastic pollution on the last day of scheduled talks, as over 100 countries pushed to cap production while a handful of oil-producing countries wanted to focus only on plastic waste.
The fifth and final U.N. Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee meeting to yield a legally binding global treaty was set to wrap up in Busan, South Korea, on Sunday, but a final plenary session had not been held as of 4:00 p.m. (0700 GMT).
A treaty could be the most significant deal relating to environmental protection as well as climate-warming emissions since the 2015 Paris Agreement.
Countries remained far apart on Sunday on the basic scope of the treaty. An option proposed by Panama, backed by over 100 countries, would create a path for a global plastic production reduction target, while another proposal did not include production caps.
The fault line was apparent in a revised document released on Sunday by the chair of the meeting, Luis Vayas Valdivieso, which could form the basis of a treaty but remained riddled with many options on the most divisive issues: capping plastic production, managing plastic products and chemicals of concern, and financing to help developing countries implement the treaty.
Some negotiators and environmental groups observing the talks expressed profound disappointment.
“If you’re calling for a high, ambitious treaty, it means that (it’s) calling for obligations, commitments on the part of all parties,” said Dr. Sam Adu-Kumi, Lead Negotiator for Ghana.
If there was no such ambitious treaty, “it means that we have to go and come back another time, not Busan but maybe somewhere else,” Dr. Adu-Kumi told Reuters.
A smaller number of petrochemical-producing nations such as Saudi Arabia have strongly opposed efforts to target plastic production and have tried to use procedural tactics to delay negotiations.
Saudi Arabia did not have an immediate comment.
China, the United States, India, South Korea and Saudi Arabia were the top five primary polymer producing nations in 2023, according to data provider Eunomia.
“If you’re not contributing constructively, and if you’re not trying to join us in having an ambitious treaty… then please get out,” Fiji’s chief negotiator, Climate Minister Sivendra Michael, told a press conference.
HOURS REMAINING
With just hours remaining for scheduled talks and consensus seemingly out of reach, some negotiators and observers openly talked about what could happen next if negotiations collapsed or were extended to another session.
Even if a legally-binding treaty is not reached at Busan, “this is a multilateral process that can keep working towards that goal,” Mexico’s head of delegation, Camila Zepeda, told Reuters.
“We have … a coalition of the willing, over a hundred countries that want this, and we can start working together” on a way forward.
Some negotiators said a few countries were holding the proceedings hostage, avoiding compromises needed by using the U.N.’s consensus process, whereby all member states agree to adopt a text without a vote.
Senegal’s National Delegate Cheikh Ndiaye Sylla called it “a big mistake” to exclude voting during the entire negotiations, an agreement made last year during the second round of talks in Paris.
Plastic production is on track to triple by 2050, and microplastics have been found in air, fresh produce and even human breast milk.
Chemicals of concern in plastics include more than 3,200 found according to a 2023 U.N. Environment Programme report, which said women and children were particularly susceptible to their toxicity.
“If it (the text) does not have the provisions of what we expect from an ambitious treaty, then we will … go back to the same process pushing for an ambitious treaty,” Sivendra said.
“Nobody is going to leave Busan with a weak treaty.”

Title: Former Australia Test opener Ian Redpath passes away at 83
Publication Date: Sun, 01 Dec 2024 11:25:45 +0000
Content: Former Australia Test opener Ian Redpath has passed away at the age of 83, said Cricket Australia (CA) on Sunday. Redpath was a regular fixture in the Australian team in the 1960s and 1970s, and served as a member of the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame.
Hailing from Geelong, Redpath played 66 Tests and made 4737 runs at an average of 43.45, including eight centuries and 31 half centuries with a top score of 171. He took 83 catches mostly in the slips where he excelled.
He made his Test debut at the MCG in the second game of the 1963-64 series against South Africa and contributed 97 to an opening partnership of 219 with fellow Victorian Bill Lawry. Redpath’s maiden Test century, 132 against the West Indies at the SCG, did not come until 1969.
But his patience and endurance had already become a trusted bulwark to some of the more flamboyant members of the Australian line-up. His seniority and leadership was acknowledged when he was made vice-captain to Ian Chappell of the Australian team for the home series against England in 1974-75 and to Greg Chappell for the series against the West Indies in 1975-76.
“Ian was a much loved and revered figure and everyone in Australian Cricket will be enormously saddened by his passing. As a fine opening batter, Ian was a mainstay of the national team through one of the great eras of Australian cricket and beloved by many throughout the world for his courage, impeccable sportsmanship and wry humour.”
“We were privileged to hear Ian speak of the wonderful experiences and relationships cricket had provided upon his induction into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2023 and this deep love of the game was manifest in his enormous contribution to cricket at first-class and community level. The thoughts of everyone at Cricket Australia are with Ian’s family and many friends at this sad time,” said CA Chairman Mike Baird.
In first-class cricket, Redpath went on to make 14,993 runs for Victoria at an average of 41.99 with 32 centuries and 84 fifties in 226 first class matches. Redpath remained an active contributor to first-class and community cricket serving as Victorian men’s coach and in various voluntary roles in his home city, particularly with the Geelong Cricket Club.
In 1975, Redpath, who also played five ODIs for Australia, was made a Member of the Civil Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire for services to cricket. He once emerged from international retirement to join World Series Cricket where injury restricted his on-field contributions, and returned to retirement.

Title: Argentina HIV patients, medics fear impact of Milei’s spending cuts
Publication Date: Sun, 01 Dec 2024 11:13:28 +0000
Content: Argentines living with HIV/AIDS and medics say spending cuts under libertarian President Javier Milei are hurting treatment of the illness and could lead to more cases, with fewer condoms for prevention and fewer tests to catch the virus early.
The right-wing leader is pushing a major austerity drive, touting his “chainsaw” to cut back the size of the state and overturn a deep fiscal deficit he inherited. That has seen budgets frozen or capped for many public sector services.
The budget for free HIV/AIDS treatment, where Argentina is a regional pioneer, fell 67% in real terms in 2024 and is set to fall 46% in 2025. That has put strain on supply of key medicines and could leave thousands without care next year, experts said.
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Most people with HIV can live near-normal lives and not suffer from AIDS-related illness with effective early treatment.
“I’ve been taking expired medication since May. Now in October they gave me medication until February, which expired in November,” Claudio Mariani, 59, who was initially diagnosed as HIV positive in 1993, told Reuters.
“In my case, for example, I’m doing the viral load test now but I don’t know when I’ll have the results,” he added.
According to official government data there are around 140,000 people living with HIV in Argentina. Around half that number depend on public sector treatment, according to the Health Ministry’s latest Epidemiological Bulletin.
The government did not respond to requests for comment.
The Huésped Foundation, which works to ensure access to care for HIV/AIDS sufferers, said more than 9,000 people would see treatment interrupted in 2025 due to the spending cuts.
The government’s draft budget would see spending on the free HIV treatment service “Program 22” rise from 21 billion to 23 billion pesos ($23 million), which with inflation at likely over 100% means a significant real-terms spending cut.
This could see patients not being diagnosed or being caught late, ironically pushing up hospital costs, experts said.
“These people require hospitalization, treatment for infections and a range of medical care that could be avoided if diagnosis is made earlier,” explained Leandro Cahn, executive director of the Huésped Foundation.
“All these cuts, far from saving money… generate more costs,” he said.
Ministry of Health data show that already this year the number of condoms distributed by the government fell to 209,328 from 503,460 the previous year, with expected drops in the supply of reagents and rapid tests likely to hinder care.
“Treatment is something permanent,” local HIV specialist Luis Trombetta told Reuters, explaining that this consistency kept down the mortality rate. “It cannot be replaced or interrupted.”

Title: Israeli strikes kill 15 in Gaza, Cairo holds fresh talks with Hamas
Publication Date: Sun, 01 Dec 2024 10:34:41 +0000
Content: Israeli military strikes killed at least 15 Palestinians in Gaza on Sunday, medics said, as Israeli forces kept up bombardments across the enclave and blew up houses on its northern edge.
In the central Gaza camp of Nuseirat, an Israeli airstrike killed six people in a house, and another attack killed three in a home in Gaza City, medics said.
Two children were killed when a missile hit a tent encampment in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip, while four other people were killed in an airstrike in Rafah, near the border with Egypt, medics told Reuters.
Residents said the military blew up clusters of houses in the northern Gaza areas of Jabalia, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, where Israeli forces have operated since October this year.
Palestinians say Israel’s operations on the northern edge of the enclave are part of a plan to clear people out through forced evacuations and bombardments to create a buffer zone – an allegation the army denies.
The military says it has killed hundreds of Hamas militants there as it fights to stop the faction regrouping almost 14 months since the war in Gaza started. Hamas’s armed wing says it has killed many Israeli forces in anti-tank rocket and mortar fire attacks, and in ambushes with explosive devices since the new operation started.
PRISONERS, TALKS
Two Palestinian detainees from Gaza have died in Israeli custody, prisoner advocacy groups said on Sunday, bringing the number of detainees reported killed since the start of the war to 47.
They named the two men as Mohammad Idris and Muath Rayyan, both in their 30s.
The Israel Prison Service said the cases were not under its jurisdiction and there was no immediate comment from the military which runs detention camps.
Israel has denied accusations from Palestinian and international human rights organizations that detainees have been mistreated and tortured in its jails and detention camps.
Meanwhile, Hamas leaders held talks in Cairo with Egyptian security officials to explore ways to reach a deal with Israel that could secure the release of hostages in return for Palestinian prisoners.
The visit was the first since the United States announced on Wednesday it would revive efforts in collaboration with Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza.
Hamas is seeking an agreement that would end the war while Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the war will only end when Hamas is eradicated.
Israel’s military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 44,300 people and displaced nearly all of the enclave’s population, Gaza officials say. Vast swathes of Gaza lie in ruins.
The conflict when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and abducting more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli officials.

Praying for Nagaland’s continuous progress in the times to come,” PM Modi posted on X.
Union Home Minister Amit Shah also extended greetings on Nagaland Day and said that Nagaland is blessed with a glorious culture and heritage.
“Warm greetings to our Naga sisters and brothers on Nagaland Day. Blessed with a glorious culture and heritage, Nagaland is a shining example of our diversity on Bharat’s rich cultural tapestry. I pray to God for the state to prosper under the leadership of Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio Ji,” Amit Shah posted on X.
BJP chief JP Nadda said that Nagaland is blessed with a mesmerizing landscape, rich traditions, and a deep cultural heritage.
“On Nagaland’s Statehood Day, I extend my warmest greetings to all my brothers and sisters of this vibrant state. Renowned as the ‘Land of Festivals,’ the state is blessed with a mesmerizing landscape, rich traditions, and a deep cultural heritage. May Nagaland continue to scale new heights of development, and may its people be blessed with good health and prosperity,” JP Nadda posted on X.
In 1957, Naga leaders and the central government reached an agreement to create a separate region of the Naga Hills. The State of Nagaland Act, 1962, was enacted by the Parliament to give Nagaland statehood.
It was formally recognized as a separate state on December 1, 1963, with Kohima being declared its capital.

Title: Australia PM Albanese says Musk pushing agenda for X in social media ban criticism
Publication Date: Sun, 01 Dec 2024 08:08:01 +0000
Content: Australia Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday that criticism by Elon Musk of Australia’s social media ban on children under 16 was the X owner pushing an agenda for the social platform, while indicating he was open to talk to the billionaire about the ban, legislated this week.
Australia approved the social media ban for children late on Thursday after an emotive debate that has gripped the nation, setting a benchmark for jurisdictions around the world with one of the toughest regulations targeting Big Tech.
The ban, which the centre-left government says is world-leading, could strain Australia’s relationship with key ally the United States, where Musk, a central figure in the administration of president-elect Donald Trump, said in a post this month it seemed a “backdoor way to control access to the Internet by all Australians”.
Albanese, asked on Sunday if he was prepared to talk to Musk about the social media ban said: “We’ll talk to anyone”.
“With regard to Elon Musk, he has an agenda, he’s entitled to push that as the owner of X, formerly known as Twitter,” Albanese added in remarks on Australian Broadcasting Corp. television.
The law forces tech giants from Instagram and Facebook owner Meta, to TikTok to stop minors logging in or face fines of up to A$49.5 million ($32 million). A trial of enforcement methods starts in January with the ban to take effect in a year.
“We are determined to get this done, the parliament has overwhelmingly passed this legislation,” Albanese told the broadcaster.
Albanese’s Labor party won crucial support from the opposition conservatives for the bill that was fast-tracked through the country’s parliament as part of 31 bills pushed through in a chaotic final day of parliament for the year.

Title: Trump threatens 100 per cent tariffs against BRICS countries if they develop own currency
Publication Date: Sun, 01 Dec 2024 06:10:37 +0000
Content: US President-Elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose 100 per cent tariffs on BRICS countries if they develop a new currency or adopt another to replace “the mighty dollar” and effectively bar them from American markets.
“There is no chance that the BRICS will replace the US Dollar in International Trade, and any country that tries should wave goodbye to America,” he posted on Truth Social on Saturday.
Threatening to close the US market to India and the other eight members of BRICS, he wrote with misplaced capitalisation of words in his style, “We require a commitment from these countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty US Dollar or, they will face 100 per cent Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful US Economy.”
Trump’s warning to BRICS — after threatening higher tariffs on imports from China, Mexico, and Canada — is premature.
External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar has already categorically ruled out the idea of a common BRICS currency.
“There is no idea of a BRICS currency. Currencies will remain a national issue for a long time to come,” he said last year ahead of the group’s summit in Johannesburg.
India is the second-biggest economy in BRICS.
Brazil’s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, nevertheless, went on to propose a common currency at the Johannesburg summit, but it has made no headway.
During his campaign, Trump had asserted that the dollar faced threats to its future as the world’s premier trading currency and said that President Joe Biden was ignoring it.
“The idea that the BRICS Countries are trying to move away from the Dollar while we stand by and watch is over,” he said in Truth Social post.
His warning to BRICS countries is more like a loyalty test to see which countries would publicly take the stand India already has and a pre-emptive warning to Beijing.
BRICS, an acronym from the names of its first set of members — Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa — expanded this year to include Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Several other countries have applied to join BRICS, which is making headway as an economy-focused organisation of the Global South.
With members in a wide range of stages of economic development and types of economies, creating a common currency would be difficult.
Accepting the currency of one member as the group’s trading currency would be impossible.
China, which is the largest economy and the biggest trading country in the group, would tend to dominate with its yuan, which India and some of the other countries will resist.
The US-led sanctions on countries like Russia and Iran helped grow some bilateral trade in non-dollar currencies.
Fueled in part by US sanctions against Russia, India has paid for its oil imports from Russia with a mix of rupees and UAE dirham.
An Indian oil importer initially made some payments in yuan, and although Russia reportedly wanted payments in the Chinese currency, the Indian government has banned it, illustrating the difficulty of adopting a BRICS currency.
The European Union has the euro, but it is for a unified economic unit –which BRICS is not and cannot be — and most of their external trade is pegged to the dollar.
In addition to being the preferred currency for trade, the dollar is the main currency in which countries hold their reserves.
According to an International Monetary Fund publication in June, the dollar continues to have an “outsized role” in the world economy, but there has been an “ongoing gradual decline in the dollar’s share of allocated foreign reserves of central banks and governments.”
Now, about 60 per cent of the reserves are in dollars.
This relates to its role as the world currency reserve, and the decline is due to “fragmentations” and reserves being parked in currencies like the yuan, South Korean won, and the dollars of Singapore, Canada, and Australia.

Publication Date: Sun, 01 Dec 2024 05:13:03 +0000
Content: In Bangladesh, the interim government has failed to tackle the country’s law and order situation, business leaders said on Saturday.  It will be difficult to maintain the economy if the situation does not improve soon, they expressed concerns at a business conference organised by the Dhaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DCCI) at a hotel in Dhaka, writes the Business Standard (TBS), a leading business daily of Bangladesh.
The government is trying to rebuild the institutions which were destroyed over the years, Selim RF Hossain, managing director of Brac Bank, said on the occasion. However, he stated that the government has failed to handle the law and order situation.
Hossain called on the government to fix the situation promptly. He warned that otherwise, it would be very, very difficult to pick up the economy, writes TBS.
Speaking at the programme, Incepta Pharmaceuticals Chairman Abdul Muktadir Rahman said, “The law and order situation has declined sharply. Nothing can be more important than this now.” He called on the government to fix a timeline to fix the situation, writes TBS.
“To reduce business costs and sustain industrial productivity the government must ensure uninterrupted gas and electricity supply while improving law enforcement,” said DCCI President Ashraf Ahmed. He also called for tax administration reforms, business process automation, and lower interest rates to support the private sector, especially small and medium enterprises, reports United News of Bangladesh (UNB).

Title: 124 killed in sectarian violence in Pakistan
Publication Date: Sun, 01 Dec 2024 05:10:20 +0000
Content: The death toll of sectarian violence in Kurram district of Pakistan’s northwest Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province rose to 124, local administration said.
An official from the local administration of the district on Saturday said that the death toll rose after 16 more people died in armed clashes during the last 24 hours, adding that over 170 others were also injured, Xinhua news agency reported.
The majority of the injured are admitted to different hospitals including those who are in critical condition, added the official.
The violence started after armed men attacked a convoy of passenger vehicles coming from the Parachinar area in the Mandori Uchit area of the district on November 21, killing 52 people, including children and women.
The incident triggered armed clashes and attacks between two groups, including Shiite and Sunni Muslims, according to the official.
The tense situation and closure of the main highway have led to severe shortages of food, fuel, and medicine, as well as suspension of internet and mobile services, besides affecting daily life in the region as fear had gripped the population.
A high-level delegation of the provincial government visited the district after the attack on passenger coaches and held meetings with elders, leading to a ceasefire agreement, but clashes could not be stopped.
Deputy Commissioner of Kurram Javedullah Mehsud told media that efforts are being made to ensure a ceasefire by involving elders from both sides to announce a ceasefire after both sides refused to pay heed to the ceasefire arranged by the government delegation.

Title: Cyclone Fengal weakens, heavy rainfall continues in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry
Publication Date: Mon, 02 Dec 2024 06:29:55 +0000
Content: Cyclone Fengal, which made landfall on Saturday, has caused extensive flooding and disruption in the region. The cyclone has weakened into a depression, moving west-northwestward at a speed of 7 km/h and is expected to dissipate into a well-marked low-pressure area over north interior Tamil Nadu, the Indian Meteorological Department said.
Cyclone’s Current Status
As of 11:30 PM on December 1, the depression was centered near latitude 12.2°N and longitude 79.2°E, approximately 40 km northwest of Villupuram, 70 km west-northwest of Puducherry, 80 km northwest of Cuddalore, and 140 km southwest of Chennai. The IMD anticipates the system will emerge over the southeast and adjoining east-central Arabian Sea off the north Kerala-Karnataka coasts by December 3. The Karaikal Doppler Weather Radar is closely monitoring the system.
Record Rainfall in Puducherry
Puducherry has experienced unprecedented rainfall, recording 48.6 cm in the last 24 hours. Lieutenant Governor Kailashnathan said, “This has been one of the highest rainfalls in Puducherry. In the last 24 hours, we recorded 48.6 cm of rainfall. The drainage infrastructure is not capable of draining such a large quantity of downpour in a day. Electric substations have been submerged, and we had to shut down the power supply. A lot of trees have fallen, many on electric lines, and those lines need to be restored. By tonight, all substations will be re-energized.”
Impact Across Tamil Nadu
Heavy rains have been lashing Tamil Nadu since Saturday morning, with Cuddalore witnessing severe flooding. A red alert was issued for Villupuram, Kallakurichi, Cuddalore, and Puducherry, while other districts like Chennai, Chengalpattu, Ranipet, Dharmapuri, Salem, and parts of the Karaikal region also braced for heavy showers.
The incessant rain caused extensive flooding in low-lying areas of Chennai, particularly in Korattur, Koyambedu, Virugambakkam, Nungambakkam, T. Nagar, and Alwarpet. The disruption led to flight operations at Chennai International Airport and local EMU train services. Airport operations resumed on Sunday morning after the cyclone subsided.
Kerala on High Alert
Kerala has also been impacted by the remnants of Cyclone Fengal. The IMD has issued a red alert for Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, and Kannur, warning of extremely heavy rainfall. An orange alert is in place for Kottayam, Ernakulam, Idukki, and Thrissur, while a yellow alert covers Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Palakkad, and northern districts.
The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has cautioned residents about potential waterlogging and traffic disruptions.
Schools and Colleges Closed
All educational institutions in Wayanad, including anganwadis and professional colleges, will remain closed on Monday, with the exception of Model Residential Schools.
Authorities in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry have also declared holidays for schools and colleges in affected districts. Educational institutions in Villupuram, Cuddalore, Vellore, and Ranipet will also remain closed on Monday.

Title: Moment of immense responsibility and opportunity: Jay Shah outlines goals as ICC chair
Publication Date: Mon, 02 Dec 2024 06:20:08 +0000
Content: Former Secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), Jay Shah, began his tenure as the Chairperson of the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Sunday, describing it as a “moment of immense responsibility and opportunity.”  
In a post on X, Shah said, “I am deeply honoured to begin my role as ICC Chair today. Cricket is a sport that unites millions across the globe, and this is a moment of immense responsibility and opportunity.”  
He emphasized his commitment to fostering the global growth of cricket, working collaboratively with member nations to enhance the sport’s reach and explore new avenues for development. “As we enter a transformative phase for cricket, I am committed to working closely with the ICC team and Member countries to grow the game’s global footprint and create new avenues for its development,” he added.  
Shah outlined his vision of making cricket accessible to a wider audience, from grassroots initiatives to marquee events. He also reaffirmed his dedication to preserving the stature of Test cricket, calling it the “pinnacle of the game,” while pledging to expand women’s cricket, which he described as the “cornerstone” of the growth strategy.  
“From grassroots initiatives to marquee events, my vision is to make cricket accessible to more people while ensuring its evolution meets the aspirations of fans worldwide,” he said.  
Shah also thanked member boards for their trust and support, promising to work together to elevate cricket to unprecedented heights and inspire the next generation.  
The ICC highlighted Shah’s focus on leveraging cricket’s inclusion in the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games as a pivotal opportunity while accelerating the growth of women’s cricket. Shah, who succeeded Greg Barclay as ICC Chair, acknowledged his predecessor’s contributions over the past four years.  
“I thank Greg Barclay for his leadership and the milestones achieved during his tenure. I look forward to collaborating with the ICC team and Member countries to expand the game’s global reach and potential,” Shah remarked.  
A veteran cricket administrator, Shah began his journey in 2009 with the Gujarat Cricket Association (GCA), where he oversaw the development of the world’s largest cricket stadium in Ahmedabad. He later became the youngest-ever honorary Secretary of the BCCI in 2019.

Title: Gambit or gamble: Russia, Ukraine, Iran and North Korea raise the nuclear stakes
Publication Date: Mon, 02 Dec 2024 06:07:25 +0000
Content: On 19 November, the Ukraine — Russia Conflict completed a thousand days. However, the day made news for two other reasons: One, Ukraine hit Russia with the longest-range U.S. missiles for the very first time. And two, Russia announced its new nuclear doctrine.
The updated doctrine establishes a framework for conditions under which the President of Russia could order a nuclear strike. The biggest change was that Russia could consider a nuclear attack in response to a conventional attack on Russia or its ally Belarus that created a critical threat to their sovereignty or territorial integrity.
The previous iteration of the doctrine, contained in a 2020 decree, had said that Russia may use nuclear weapons in case of a nuclear attack by an enemy, or, a conventional attack that threatened the existence of the state.
So, by replacing the words ‘existence of the state’ with ‘sovereignty or territorial integrity’, Russia has effectively lowered the threshold for a nuclear strike in response to a broader range of conventional attacks.
The new doctrine announced by President Vladimir Putin says that any attack by a non-nuclear power, supported by a nuclear power, would be considered a joint attack. Also, any attack by one member of a military bloc would be considered an attack by the entire alliance.
Moscow claims that Ukraine could not have launched those missiles without U.S. support and therefore it makes the U.S. become directly involved in the Ukraine — Russia Conflict.
Two days later, on 21 November, Russia fired a new experimental hypersonic missile at Ukraine. It was called the Oreshnik, which means a Hazel Tree in Russian. A hypersonic missile is one that can travel at 5 times the speed of sound, that is 6 thousand 2 hundred kilometres per hour.
The Oreshnik carried six warheads. Putin says that the weapon travelled at a speed of Mach 10 or 10 times the speed of sound. He claims that there is no technology currently available that can counter the Oreshnik.
Russia is also putting its Sarmat Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles on combat alert. The Sarmat, dubbed Satan-2 by the media, is a key element of Russia’s nuclear arsenal. It is capable of wielding up to 16 nuclear warheads and striking anywhere from nearly 18-thousand kilometres away.
That’s not all.
The New York Times newspaper cited unidentified Western officials as saying that the U.S. could give Ukraine nuclear weapons. Moscow says that such an idea is suicidal.
A Putin aide, Dmitry Medvedev, warns that Moscow could consider such a transfer to be tantamount to an attack on Russia, and retaliate with a nuclear weapon.
Ukraine inherited nuclear weapons from the erstwhile Soviet Union after its 1991 collapse but it gave them up under a 1994 agreement — called the Budapest Memorandum — in return for security assurances from Russia, the U.S. and the U.K.
Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly complained that doing so left his country without security, which is why he argues that Ukraine should be admitted to the NATO military alliance, something that Moscow opposes.
Ukraine using the longest-range U.S. missiles for the first time, Russia revising its nuclear doctrine and talk of the U.S. giving Ukraine nuclear weapons have all raised anxieties about the potential for a nuclear conflict. So is the world really on the brink of a nuclear conflict? A third World War? What will happen if North Korea conducts a seventh nuclear test? Or Iran changes its nuclear policy?
Iran’s Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Araghchi is saying that the nuclear debate inside Iran is likely to shift towards the possession of its own weapons, if the West goes ahead with a threat to re-impose all sanctions.
“So I can tell you, quite frankly, that there is this debate going on in Iran, and mostly among the elites – even among the ordinary people — whether we should change this policy or not, whether we should change our nuclear doctrine, as some say, or not, because it has proved insufficient in practice.”
Kamal Kharrazi, an adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, says that Iran has the capacity to produce nuclear weapons but, for the moment, the Fatwa against the possession of nuclear weapons could only be changed by Khamenei.
As for North Korea, a U.S. diplomat says that Pyongyang is only a political decision away from carrying out its seventh nuclear test.
“The United States assesses that (North Korea) has prepared its Punggye-ri test site for its potential seventh explosive nuclear test,” says Alexandra Bell, U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for nuclear affairs.
The diplomat tells a conference organised by the Korea Society in Washington, D.C. that such a test would constitute a grave escalation of tensions in the region and present a security risk to the entire world.
In the days leading up to the U.S. presidential election, North Korea test-fired an inter-continental ballistic missile for the first time in almost a year. The missile flew for 85 minutes — the longest duration registered yet in any such test by Pyongyang. In addition to the I.C.B.M., North Korea test-fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles just before the U.S. election.
North Korea’s previous nuclear test, conducted in September 2017, was by far its most powerful ever. It took place in the first year of Donald Trump’s presidency, before he and Kim Jong-un held a maiden U.S. — North Korean summit at Singapore in 2018.
The awarding of the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize to a grassroots movement of atomic-bomb survivors from Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan reflects a widely held fear that the planet has never been closer to a nuclear war. The citation reads that the Prize was awarded to the Nihon Hidankyo “for its efforts to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons and for demonstrating through witness testimony that nuclear weapons must never be used again”.
Next year will mark the 80th anniversary of the dropping of nuclear bombs by the U.S. on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 that forced Japan’s surrender.
Will the world take heed?

Title: At least 25 killed as Russian, Syrian jets intensify bombing of Syrian rebel territory
Publication Date: Mon, 02 Dec 2024 05:59:22 +0000
Content: At least 25 people were killed in northwestern Syria in air strikes carried out by the Syrian government and Russia, the Syrian opposition-run rescue service known as the White Helmets said early on Monday.
Russian and Syrian jets struck the rebel-held city of Idlib in northern Syria on Sunday, military sources said, as President Bashar al-Assad vowed to crush insurgents who had swept into the city of Aleppo.
The army also said it had recaptured several towns that rebels had overrun in recent days.
Residents said one attack hit a crowded residential area in the centre of Idlib, the largest city in a rebel enclave near the Turkish border where around four million people live in makeshift tents and dwellings.
At least seven people were killed and dozens injured, according to rescuers at the scene. The Syrian army and its ally Russia say they target the hideouts of insurgent groups and deny attacking civilians.
Ten children were among the dead in the air strikes in and around Idlib and other targets in rebel-held territory near Aleppo on Sunday, according the White Helmets.
The total death toll from Syrian and Russian strikes since Nov. 27 had climbed to 56, including 20 children, the group added in a statement on X.
The insurgents are a coalition of Turkey-backed mainstream secular armed groups along with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist group that has been designated a terrorist outfit by the U.S., Russia, Turkey and other states.
The insurgents seized control of all of Idlib province in recent days, the boldest rebel assault for years in a civil war where front lines had largely been frozen since 2020.
Insurgents also swept into the city of Aleppo, east of Idlib, on Friday night, forcing the army to redeploy.
In remarks published on state media, Assad said: “Terrorists only know the language of force and it is the language we will crush them with”.
The Syrian army said dozens of its soldiers had been killed in the fighting in Aleppo.
Russian war bloggers reported on Sunday that Moscow had dismissed Sergei Kisel, the general in charge of its forces in Syria, after insurgents swept into Aleppo. Reuters has requested comment from the Russian defence ministry.
In a joint statement, the United States, France, Germany, and Britain urged “de-escalation by all parties and the protection of civilians and infrastructure to prevent further displacement and disruption of humanitarian access”.
LEAVING ALEPPO
Inside Aleppo city, streets were mostly empty and many shops were closed on Sunday as scared residents stayed at home. There was still a heavy flow of civilians leaving the city, witnesses and residents said.
Rebel fighters waving the opposition flag drove through the city, Yusuf Khatib, a resident, told Reuters by phone. Some rebels took up positions on street intersections, he added.
Ahmad Tutenji, a merchant in the affluent New Aleppo neighbourhood, said he was surprised how quickly the army left. “I am shocked at how they fled and abandoned us.”
Abdullah al Halabi, a pensioner whose neighbourhood was bombed near the central area of Qasr al Baladi, said people were terrified they would see a repeat of the Russian-led bombing that killed thousands of people before driving out rebels a decade ago.
Syrian troops who had withdrawn from the city were now regrouping and reinforcements were also being sent to help in the counter-attack, army sources said.
Aleppo had been firmly held by the government since a 2016 victory there, one of the war’s major turning points, when Russian-backed Syrian forces besieged and laid waste to rebel-held eastern areas of what had been the country’s largest city.
Rebels said on Sunday they had pushed further south of Aleppo city and captured the town of Khansir in an attempt to cut the army’s main supply route to Aleppo city.
Rebel sources said they had also captured Sheikh Najjar estate, one of the country’s major industrial zones.
The war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced many millions, has ground on since 2011 with no formal end. Most heavy fighting halted years ago after Iran-backed militias and Russian air power helped Assad win control of all major cities.
A lack of that manpower contributed to the speedy retreat of Syrian army forces in recent days, according to two army sources.
The rebel gains came after Israel stepped up its strikes on Iranian bases in Syria and Iran-backed Hezbollah forces in Lebanon. Militias allied to Iran, led by Hezbollah, have had a strong presence in the Aleppo area.
Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, visiting Damascus on Sunday, said the situation in Syria was “difficult” but the Assad government would prevail.

Title: Sensex, Nifty fall as lower GDP numbers weigh on investor sentiment
Publication Date: Mon, 02 Dec 2024 05:48:59 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices were subdued on Monday after the release of lower-than-expected GDP figures on Friday.
The Nifty 50 opened with a modest gain of 9 points at 24,140, while the Sensex dropped 58 points, starting at 79,743.87.
By 9:42 am, the Sensex had declined further by 140.80 points, or 0.18%, to 79,661.99, and the Nifty had slipped 12.25 points, or 0.05%, to 24,118.85.
On the National Stock Exchange, 1,254 stocks advanced, while 1,076 declined.
India’s economy grew by 5.4% year-on-year in the July-September quarter, according to data released on Friday. This growth figure fell short of the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) forecast of 7%.
The combination of subdued GDP data and weak second-quarter corporate earnings contributed to increased selling pressure.
Among sectoral indices, Nifty Auto, Media, Metal, Pharma, and Realty saw gains, while Nifty Bank, FMCG, IT, and Oil & Gas sectors posted losses.
Among the Nifty 50 constituents, only 15 stocks advanced, while 34 declined. Shares of Adani Green Energy surged by over 6%.
Ajay Bagga, a banking and market expert, said, “The lower-than-expected GDP number is weighing on Indian markets. While GDP is a lagging indicator and largely factored in, weak corporate earnings indicate slow growth.”
He added, “Without counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary measures, GDP may remain stagnant, further elevating market valuations and creating pressure.”
The Reserve Bank of India is expected to lower the cash reserve ratio (CRR) in its upcoming monetary policy meeting on December 6, which could provide some relief to banking stocks. However, with CPI inflation at 6.2%, interest rate cuts remain unlikely.
In broader Asian markets, Taiwan’s Weighted Index rose by over 2%, while Japan’s Nikkei 225, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, and South Korea’s KOSPI traded flat.

Title: Chinks in Xi’s armour: Xi Jinping’s trusted aides falling like ninepins
Publication Date: Mon, 02 Dec 2024 05:39:58 +0000
Content: First it was his hand-picked foreign minister Qin Gang. Then it was Defence Minister Gen. Li Shangfu, a protege of his childhood friend. And now it’s his close aide Admiral Miao Hua. One by one, Xi Jinping’s trusted lieuemants and aides are falling like ninepins.
That not all is right in the higher echelons of the Chinese government can be had from the fact that in the last one year alone, 20 military personnel have been removed.
Chinese Defence Ministry Spokesperson Wu Qian says that the Chinese Communist Party has decided to suspend Admiral Miao from duty pending an investigation for, quote-unquote, serious breach of discipline. A “serious breach of discipline” is nothing but code for corruption.
Admiral Miao is the latest Chinese Government official to be sacked by President Xi Jinping. His fall from grace is all the more shocking because it was Xi himself who had promoted him in 2015 and made him the youngest serving Admiral in the Chinese Navy.
Admiral Miao was no ordinary officer. He was heading the Political Work Department of China’s Central Military Commission, which oversees party ideology and personnel changes.  It’s the apex body of China’s military leadership. And Xi Jinping chairs it. So, a Central Military Commission membership means direct access to Xi.
The 69-year-old Admiral spent years doing party work in the south-eastern coastal province of Fujian but his career took off only after Xi came to power in 2012. His time in Fujian overlapped with Xi’s years there. Xi rose from being a party official to the Governor of the province between 1999 and 2002.
The Admiral was last seen in public on 7 October, when he attended the 70th anniversary celebration of a State-run para-military organisation in Xinjiang.
Admiral Miao is the second Central Military Commission member to be removed from office since the current line-up took office in 2022. The first was former defence minister Gen. Li Shangfu, who was sacked in October 2023. Both Li and his predecessor, Gen. Wei Fenghe, were expelled from the party in June this year for, quote-unquote, “serious violations of discipline”.
According to a media report, it has left the seven-member Central Military Commission chaired by Xi Jinping with a rare double vacancy and only two serving members, apart from Xi and the two vice-chairpersons. It’s a situation not seen in decades.
The Admiral’s sacking comes close on the heels of a report published by the Financial Times newspaper of the U.K. that China’s current defence minister, Admiral Dong Jun, is being investigated for alleged corruption. Admiral Dong was also appointed by Xi Jinping.
Christopher Johnson, a former analyst with U.S. spy agency Central Intelligence Agency, tells Financial Times that the development raises concerns about how Xi is picking his defence ministers. “Xi bucked tradition in 2018 by naming Wei, from the P.L.A. Rocket Forces, to the post instead of an Army General. With Dong, a Navy man, Xi’s military personnel dons assured him the vetting was airtight after a four-month search. So Xi is left to wonder, what corner of the P.L.A. is not corrupt?”
The recent sackings raise more questions.
Is corruption eroding China’s combat readiness?
Is Xi really rooting out corruption or using his anti-corruption drive as a ruse to purge his political rivals?
Joel Wuthnow, a senior research fellow at National Defence University in the U.S. tells A.F.P. news agency that it has to be a huge distraction for Xi as he presses his military to be ready for a war with Taiwan by 2027. Xi has vowed that the re-unification of Taiwan with the Chinese Mainland is inevitable. He has pledged to take all measures necessary to achieve that goal. The sacking of key Chinese defence personnel comes at a time when Beijing is increasing military pressure on Taiwan and ratcheting up the tensions in the contested waters of the Indo-Pacific.
Meanwhile, Defence Minister Admiral Dong Jun’s case is getting curiouser and curiouser. Chinese Defence Ministry Spokesperson Wu Qian says that the Minister remains in his position and that the Financial Times report is a fabrication
A former Navy chief, Admiral Dong was last seen outside China on 21 November when he delivered a speech at the Asean Defence Ministers’ Meeting in Lao P.D.R.’s capital Vientiane. He declined to meet his U.S. counterpart Gen. Lloyd Austin on the margins of that meeting citing U.S. actions over Taiwan but he did hold talks with the defence ministers of India, New Zealand and Malaysia. In fact, it was the first meeting between India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Admiral Dong after India and China agreed in October to end a four-year-long military standoff. It was also the first such meeting after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Xi Jinping met on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia.
The Chinese defence minister has traditionally been a member of both the Central Military Commission and the State Council, which is China’s cabinet-level executive body. Former defence ministers Gen. Li and Gen. Wei were both members of the Central Military Commission. They were both State Councillors, too. However, Admiral Dong was neither promoted to the Central Military Commission at a Communist Party meeting held this year nor was he appointed to the State Council during a Government reshuffle in March.
 
Admiral Dong replaced Gen. Li as defence minister in December 2023. Gen. Li was himself removed seven months into the job for allegedly taking bribes in exchange for granting favours in violation of military and party discipline. Gen. Wei was defence minister for five years prior to that, until he was accused of similar charges and placed under investigation for, quote-unquote, “seriously violating political and organisational discipline by helping others gain improper benefits in personnel arrangements.”
Both Gen. Li and Gen. Wei have since been expelled from the Communist Party of China. They are being investigated for corruption.
What is also common to Gen. Li and Gen. Wei is that both were associated with China’s Rocket Force. While Gen. Wei used to head it, Gen. Li headed a department that developed weapons, including missiles. Xi Jinping set up the Rocket Force in 2016 to oversee China’s nuclear and conventional missiles. A Bloomberg report cites U.S. intelligence as saying that corruption in the Rocket Force led to malfunctioning equipment and even missile fuel being replaced with water! 
Incidentally, many more personnel from the Rocket Force have been sacked. The Rocket Force chief Gen. Li Yuchao was sacked in July 2023 along with his Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Sun Jinming. Both were expelled from the party and investigated for corruption. Also sacked were Gen. Li Yuchao’s deputy Gen. Liu Guangbin and a former deputy Lt. Gen. Zhang Zhenzhong.
Three senior officials were also removed from their posts at state-owned missile defence organisations in December 2023.
Neil Thomas, a fellow on Chinese politics at the New York City-headquartered Asia Society, says that “the rot in China’s military remains even  deeper than previously suspected”.
Heather Williams from the Washington, D.C.-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies says that “corruption in the Chinese military rightly should raise questions about its ability to achieve military objectives and reach the ‘great rejuvenation’ envisioned by Xi”.
Little wonder then that a recent statement issued by the Central Military Commission reads that “senior party committees and senior cadres of the Army must take the lead in respecting, studying, obeying and applying the law.”

Title: UN refugee agency halts Gaza aid deliveries amid rampant looting
Publication Date: Mon, 02 Dec 2024 05:19:54 +0000
Content: The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) has suspended its aid operations through the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza following a series of armed robberies that have disrupted humanitarian assistance to the besieged territory. The decision comes after armed gangs seized an entire convoy of aid trucks on November 16, followed by another raid on food trucks on November 29.
UNRWA officials cite multiple challenges hampering their humanitarian mission, including the ongoing siege of Gaza, Israeli restrictions on aid quantities, the targeting of local police, and widespread looting. According to UN estimates, more than a third of aid entering Gaza is being stolen, with much of the organized looting occurring in zones under Israeli military drone surveillance but lacking ground troops.
Aid agencies have criticized Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories(COGAT), the Israeli military agency responsible for coordinating humanitarian assistance, for failing to prevent the criminal gangs’ activities. The situation has been exacerbated by the escape of hundreds of convicted criminals from prisons early in the conflict, following bombing raids and the departure of police forces.
The crisis comes amid heightened tensions between Israel and UNRWA. In October, the Israeli Knesset passed a resolution to ban the agency from operating in Israel and end cooperation with the organization. Israel has long criticized UNRWA, established by the UN in 1949, accusing it of anti-Israel bias and claiming it perpetuates the Palestinian refugee situation by maintaining their permanent refugee status.

Content: The 45th Gulf Cooperation Council Summit, held in Kuwait on December 1, concluded with the Kuwait Declaration, emphasizing urgent action to end the Gaza conflict and reaffirming support for Palestinian sovereignty. The declaration called for an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, encompassing territories occupied since June 1967.
In response to ongoing regional tensions, GCC leaders strongly condemned Israel’s military actions in Gaza, Lebanon, and the West Bank, including violations at Jerusalem’s holy sites. They praised Qatar’s mediation efforts in securing ceasefire agreements and facilitating detainee exchanges. The leaders expressed particular concern about Israeli aggression in Lebanon, warning of potential regional escalation and calling for the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701.
Beyond regional security, the summit highlighted the GCC’s expanding role in addressing global challenges. Leaders emphasized the region’s growing prominence as a business and economic hub, focusing on sustainable economic diversification and digital transformation.
