Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 13:00:20 +0000
Content: Leaders of the Mahayuti alliance were sworn in as cabinet ministers in the Maharashtra government during a ceremony at Raj Bhavan in Nagpur on Sunday.  
The Mahayuti alliance comprises the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and the Shiv Sena. 
BJP leaders, including state unit chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule, Ashish Shelar, Ganesh Naik, Mangal Prabhat Lodha, Pankaja Munde, Girish Mahajan, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, Chandrakant Patil, and Nitesh Rane, took the oath of office.  
Representing Shiv Sena’s Eknath Shinde faction, leaders such as Shambhuraj Desai, Dadaji Dagadu Bhuse, Sanjay Rathod, Uday Samant, Gulabrao Patil, and Sanjay Shirsat were also sworn in. Additionally, NCP leaders Aditi Tatkare, Dhananjay Munde, and Hasan Mushrif joined the Cabinet.  
Maharashtra Governor CP Radhakrishnan administered the oath to the newly inducted ministers, in the presence of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Deputy Chief Ministers Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar.  
This Cabinet expansion occurred over two weeks after CM Fadnavis and his two deputies were sworn in on December 5. The Mahayuti alliance, which commands a significant majority in the Assembly, had faced criticism from the opposition for delaying the Cabinet announcement.  
In the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly Election, the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance secured a landslide victory, winning 235 seats. The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 132 seats, while Shiv Sena and the NCP won 57 and 41 seats, respectively.

Title: Will end naxalism in Chhattisgarh by March 2026: Amit Shah
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 11:42:46 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday reiterated the government’s commitment to eradicating maoism in Chhattisgarh by March 31, 2026. He lauded the state police for their efforts in combating Left-wing extremism over the past year.  
Speaking at an event in Raipur to commemorate the President’s Colour Award being conferred on the Chhattisgarh Police, Shah urged maoists to join the mainstream and take advantage of the state government’s surrender policy.  
“I have worked closely with the Chhattisgarh Police on anti-Naxal operations and can confidently say that they are among the most courageous forces in the country, fighting Naxals and improving the lives of citizens,” he said.  
The home minister highlighted that in the past year, 287 extremists were neutralised, nearly 1,000 arrested, and 837 surrendered. He also noted that the top 14 Naxal leaders were eliminated during this period. For the first time in four decades, fatalities among troops and civilians have dropped below 100 in a single year.  
Shah credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership for a significant reduction in violence, stating that fatalities among security forces decreased by 73%, and civilian deaths dropped by 70% over the past decade compared to the previous one.  
He added that the motto of “Viksit Chhattisgarh, Viksit Bastar” would receive a renewed push from the state police, who achieved the rare distinction of receiving the President’s Colour Award before completing 25 years of service.  
Referring to the state’s political journey, Shah recalled that when Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee established Chhattisgarh in 2000, the BJP-led government served for 15 years. “Now, with Vishnu Deo Sai as Chief Minister, I assure you that we will free Chhattisgarh from Naxalism by March 31, 2026,” he declared.  
Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai congratulated the police force on the honour and highlighted initiatives by both the central and state governments to rehabilitate surrendered extremists. These include providing 15,000 houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, financial aid, land grants for agriculture, and reservations in educational institutions for surrendered extremists and their families.  
The chief minister also detailed welfare measures for victims of Maoist violence, including technical education reservations, skill development programs for women, and land allocation for housing and agriculture.

Title: South Korea to invest $1.9 billion in tech to tackle climate change
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 11:41:30 +0000
Content: The South Korean government plans to invest 2.7 trillion won ($1.9 billion) in developing technologies to combat climate change next year, the Ministry of Science and ICT announced on Sunday.  
This represents a 3.9 percent increase from the 2.6 trillion won allocated for the initiative in 2024, according to the ministry.  
The investment forms part of the government’s 10-year plan to advance scientific technologies by 2032 in response to global warming, Yonhap News Agency reported. South Korea has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent from 2018 levels by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.  
The 2025 budget will focus on developing core renewable energy technologies, such as next-generation solar batteries and large-scale floating wind power systems. It will also prioritize advancements in carbon-neutral technologies, including next-generation nuclear power systems and hydrogen power.  
The government aims to assess the vulnerability of forests, marine areas, and ecosystems to climate change while implementing measures to ensure stable food production.  
Meanwhile, the science ministry has completed a comprehensive roadmap for achieving carbon neutrality across various industries. The Presidential Special Committee on Carbon Neutrality Technologies has devised strategies for six key sectors: wind power, energy storage, the environment, and more.  
With these guidelines, South Korea now has a comprehensive plan to develop carbon reduction technologies in 17 areas, spanning industries such as steelmaking, chemicals, car manufacturing, and nuclear power. Specific initiatives include the development of next-generation offshore wind turbines, integrated energy systems, and eco-friendly data centers.

Title: Indian SCBs post record net profit of ₹23.50 lakh crore in FY24, reduce NPAs
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 11:17:57 +0000
Content: Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) in India have achieved a significant milestone by recording the highest-ever aggregate net profit of ₹23.50 lakh crore in FY2023-24, compared to ₹22.63 lakh crore in FY2022-23, according to the Ministry of Finance.  
The asset quality of SCBs has also improved remarkably, with the gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio declining to 2.67% (₹4.75 lakh crore) in June 2024 from a peak of 11.18% (₹10.36 lakh crore) in March 2018. Public Sector Banks (PSBs) reported a similar improvement, with their gross NPA ratio dropping to 3.32% in June 2024, compared to 14.58% in March 2018 and 4.97% in March 2015.  
Additionally, the provision coverage ratio (PCR) of SCBs has risen from 49.31% in March 2015 to a robust 92.52% in June 2024, reflecting increased resilience in the banking sector.  
The Reserve Bank of India’s recent stress test results indicate that SCBs remain well-capitalized and capable of withstanding macroeconomic shocks without requiring additional capital infusion. All banks are expected to meet the minimum regulatory Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 5.5%, even under severe stress scenarios.  
PSBs recorded their highest-ever net profit of ₹1.41 lakh crore in FY2023-24, up from ₹1.05 lakh crore in FY2022-23. In the first half of FY2024-25, PSBs achieved a net profit of ₹0.86 lakh crore, underscoring their strong financial performance.

Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 08:59:56 +0000
Content: Parliamentarians under the Rajya Sabha Chairman XI and Lok Sabha Speaker XI played a friendly cricket match at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium on Sunday.  
BJP MP Anurag Thakur captained the Lok Sabha Speaker XI, while Union Minister Kiren Rijiju led the Rajya Sabha Chairman XI. The friendly match was named the “TB Mukt Bharat Awareness Cricket Match.”  
 
Speaking to ANI, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju said, “Several of our MP colleagues have come here. With the mantra of fitness, this event was scheduled to energize people through sports. I believe everyone will play with enthusiasm. Our mantra is ‘TB-Free India’ and the ‘Fit India Movement.’”
 
“Without fitness, you cannot serve the country. You must be fit both mentally and physically,” he added.  
 
“PM Modi has set the goal of making India TB-free by 2025, while the global goal is 2030. Since 2015, there has been a 38% drop in TB-related deaths in India, and an 18% reduction in new cases. This number is around 8% globally. This means India is performing better than the rest of the world”,.BJP MP Anurag Thakur said while speaking to reporters.  
 
“Despite being the most populous country, there is treatment available. The government provides free medicines and financial support of Rs 1000 for the treatment. Cases are also tracked”.
 
AAP MP Raghav Chadha praised the initiative, saying, “This is a great initiative. The match is being played for a good cause. I believe the awareness of this cause will spread to every corner of the country through this match.”  
 
“Additionally, while elections end, the animosity in the political arena between leaders continues even after that. I think that through such teamwork initiatives, animosity will be diminished, and we will work as a team for Bharat Mata to take the country forward,” Chadha said while speaking to ANI.  
 
BJP MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy felt that the MPs’ effort towards a TB-free India was unique.  
 
“This is a unique effort by MPs towards a TB-free India. The captain of our team is Anurag Thakur, who had been the Sports Minister. This is another side of MPs. Cricket is the most popular sport in the world,” he said.  
 
BJP MP Manoj Tiwari said that through this friendly match, they aim to raise awareness about TB and told reporters, “We want to give a message that we, as MPs, will still run on the field, play this match, and try to create awareness about TB. TB can be defeated with a little awareness. Who wins today’s match is a different matter, but we must defeat TB and make the country win.”  
 
Union Minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu expressed his happiness, saying, “I am very happy to participate, especially with all the MPs today. I would like to congratulate the organizers for putting together a great event. The PM has committed to defeating TB by 2025, and a series of events have been organized based on this. Today, we are taking another step forward to create more awareness in the country and unite everyone in the fight against TB.”  
 
Former India captain and Congress leader Mohammad Azharuddin remarked, “It is a joy to meet everyone like this and for MPs to get an outing like this. The country should indeed be TB-free. It should be eradicated as soon as possible. I am happy to be participating today.”  
 
BJP MP Ravi Kishan gave his take on the “historic match” while speaking to ANI, saying, “This will be a historic match. The youth must be awakened and freed from drugs and TB. We will fulfill PM Modi’s dreams when we create awareness about TB among our children.”  
 
The government’s commitment to “End TB by 2025” was first articulated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the “End TB Summit” held in New Delhi in March 2018 and was reaffirmed at the “One World TB Summit” in Varanasi on World TB Day 2023, as per an official release.
 
At this summit, the Prime Minister emphasized the need for a decisive and revitalized response to TB.

Title: PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana surpasses 6.85 lakh installations
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 08:12:21 +0000
Content: The PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana scheme has recorded over 6.85 lakh installations to date and is on track to surpass a decade’s worth of solar growth in just one year.
Launched in February this year, the scheme has already reached 86 percent of the total installations made in the previous decade, with 685,763 installations so far.
The demand was particularly high for the 3-5 kW load segment, which accounted for 77 percent of installations, while 14 percent of the installations were in the higher-than-5 kW segment. Gujarat recorded the highest number of installations, followed by Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Kerala.
Gujarat saw the maximum number of solar installations under the initiative, with 2,86,545 installations. Maharashtra followed with 1,26,344 installations, while Uttar Pradesh recorded 53,423 installations.
As of now, around 1.45 crore registrations have been completed under the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, as reported in Parliament. The scheme aims to provide solar power to one crore households by March 2027.
Launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the scheme aims to achieve one crore rooftop solar installations in the residential sector by fiscal year 2027, with a budget allocation of Rs 75,021 crore.
States like Tripura, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, and Manipur have also seen an increase in installations.
To promote the PM Solar Scheme at the grassroots level, Urban Local Bodies and Panchayats have been incentivized to encourage rooftop solar systems in their jurisdictions. The scheme is also contributing to increased income, reduced power bills, and job creation.
With the goal of benefiting one crore households, the program is expected to save the government Rs 75,000 crore annually in electricity costs.
The scheme offers a subsidy of up to 40 percent to households, making renewable energy more affordable and accessible.
The government is partnering with all stakeholders, including REC, DISCOMs, and vendors, to address any challenges and ensure the successful implementation of the scheme.

Title: Cold wave sweeps northern Odisha; Ramatirtha in Mayurbhanj records lowest temperature at -10°C
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 08:03:02 +0000
Content: A severe cold wave gripped northern Odisha on Sunday, with the Mayurbhanj district experiencing the worst of the intense chill. The Ramatirtha area in the district recorded temperatures as low as -10 degrees Celsius. 
According to the Forest Department, other areas in Mayurbhanj also reported extremely low temperatures: Gurguria and Barehipani recorded 6 degrees Celsius, Chahala 4 degrees Celsius, Nawana -5 degrees Celsius, and Upper Baraha Kamuda (UBK) -3 degrees Celsius.
On Saturday, IMD scientist Dr. Soma Sen Roy stated that the cold wave in north and central India is expected to last for one to two days, with temperatures likely to rise by December 16-17. “North-westerly winds are currently blowing, and south-easterly winds will soon follow in North India. There is a possibility of a 1-2 degree Celsius drop in temperature in Delhi. Cold wave conditions have been recorded in Punjab and Madhya Pradesh and will persist for the next one to two days,” she said.
The Meteorological Department has forecast cold wave conditions in isolated pockets of Jammu-Kashmir-Ladakh-Gilgit-Baltistan-Muzaffarabad during December 14-16, Punjab on December 15, Haryana, Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gangetic West Bengal, and Odisha on December 14-15, West Rajasthan during December 17-20, East Rajasthan during December 14-20, and Madhya Pradesh on December 16.
In Srinagar, the maximum temperature was 9 degrees Celsius, while the minimum dropped to -5 degrees Celsius, according to the IMD.
Winter has also tightened its grip on the hill town of Shimla and its surrounding regions following a fresh spell of snowfall. The icy conditions have disrupted daily life for residents, causing significant challenges.
In Delhi, a thin layer of fog covered parts of the national capital as the minimum temperature dropped to 7 degrees Celsius, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). With temperatures dipping, many sought refuge in shelter homes.
Ved Pal, who manages a shelter near AIIMS Delhi, said that food and adequate bedding are provided to those seeking shelter. “This is a family shelter where we provide proper beds and as many blankets as they need. They are also given food twice a day, along with tea and rusk in the morning,” he told ANI.
Pal added that medical facilities are also available at the shelter. “We have a first aid box, and medicines are distributed based on a doctor’s recommendations. For more serious cases, we assist residents in getting to a hospital. General medicines like paracetamol are also stocked,” he said.

Title: One Nation, One Election Bill will not be tabled in Lok Sabha on Monday
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 07:31:08 +0000
Content: The ‘One Nation, One Election’ Bill, officially titled the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2024, will not be tabled in the Lok Sabha on Monday. The revised business list for the day does not include the Bill.
The initial schedule had listed the Bill for Monday, stating: “… Arjun Ram Meghwal to move for leave to introduce a Bill further to amend the Constitution of India. Also to introduce the Bill.”
The minister was also slated to introduce The Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, which seeks to amend the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963, the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991, and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019.
The first amendment Bill proposed simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies, while the second focused on aligning assembly elections in Delhi, Jammu & Kashmir, and Puducherry.
However, with the revised list omitting these Bills, it is now speculated that the One Nation, One Election Bill will not be tabled on Monday. The winter session is scheduled to conclude on December 20, and sources suggest the Bills might be introduced later this week or through a last-minute Supplementary List of Business with the Speaker’s approval.
On Thursday, the Union Cabinet had approved the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2024, and the Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024. Both Bills were circulated to MPs on Friday evening.
The proposals are based on recommendations by a high-level committee chaired by former President Ram Nath Kovind. The committee submitted its findings in March, highlighting the challenges posed by prolonged election cycles.
The 18,626-page report, prepared over 191 days, emphasized that simultaneous elections could ensure policy stability, reduce voter fatigue, and increase electoral participation.
Following the Cabinet’s approval, several opposition leaders criticized the proposal, labeling it impractical and a threat to federalism. They raised concerns over the government’s plan to table the Bill in the ongoing winter session.
The revised business list includes The Readjustment of Representation of Scheduled Tribes in Assembly Constituencies of the State of Goa Bill, 2024. This Bill seeks to ensure the reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in Goa’s Legislative Assembly, as per Article 332 of the Constitution, and to adjust seats in light of recent changes to the Scheduled Tribes list for the state.

Title: Ukraine to set up mechanism to supply food to Syria, Zelenskiy says
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 07:30:45 +0000
Content: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday he had instructed his government to set up supply mechanisms to deliver together with international organisations and partners food to Syria in the aftermath of the fall of President Bashar al-Assad.
Ukraine has been one of the world’s top grain and oilseeds exporters, and has been exporting wheat and corn to Middle Eastern countries, but not to Syria.
Syria imported food from Russia during the Assad era, but Russian wheat supplies have been suspended amid the uncertainty and payment delays, Russian and Syrian sources said on Friday.
“We are ready to assist Syria in preventing a food crisis, particularly through the humanitarian program ‘Grain from Ukraine’,” Zelenskiy wrote on X.
“I have instructed the government to establish food supply mechanisms in cooperation with international organizations and partners who can help.”
Ukraine’s exports were buffeted by Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, which severely reduced shipments via the Black Sea. Ukraine has since broken a de facto sea blockade and revived exports from its southern ports of Odesa.

Title: Brisbane Test: Smith joins century party with Head as Australia dominate day two
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 05:44:38 +0000
Content: Steve Smith clambered out of his form slump with a drought-breaking century and Travis Head smashed another big ton as Australia posted a commanding 405 for seven on day two of the third test against India in Brisbane on Sunday.
Smith batted away questions about his place in the team with a hard-earned 101 while Head marched on to a swashbuckling 152 to the delight of most of the 34,227-strong crowd at the Gabba.
“It was nice to get in, feel good,” said Smith, who scored his 33rd test ton and first since Lord’s at the 2023 Ashes.
“I missed out for a little while now so it’s nice to get three figures again.”
It took Jasprit Bumrah to salvage something from a tough day for India, the pace spearhead taking three wickets after tea to finish the day with his 12th five-wicket haul.
Seizing the new ball, he had Smith edge to Rohit in the slips to break a 241-partnership with Head before removing all-rounder Mitchell Marsh (five) and Head in quick succession.
 
But Bumrah’s bravery also amplified India’s heavy reliance on their star quick.
 
Recalled pacer Akash Deep and spinner Ravindra Jadeja were wicketless while seamer Mohammed Siraj spent time off-field after clutching at his hamstring when bowling in the morning.
 
Alex Carey was unbeaten on 45 and Mitchell Starc was on seven at stumps, having pushed Australia past 400.
 
CHALLENGING WICKET
 
The day belonged to Head and Smith, the former backing up his match-winning 140 in the pink ball test in Adelaide and the latter posting his 10th ton against India.
Hitting Deep for a single off his pads, Smith ended his longest streak without a hundred, bringing the Gabba crowd to their feet. The 35-year-old threw an icy stare at the Australian team and kissed the crest on his helmet.
Head hurtled to three figures, hitting a Bumrah full toss for three in the final minutes before tea to bring up his ninth test ton, then flying past 150 at nearly a run a ball.
“Nice to come out and start again, build a nice partnership and be able to contribute to the day,” said Head.

Title: South Korea court begins review of Yoon impeachment over martial law attempt
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 07:25:18 +0000
Content: South Korea’s Constitutional Court on Monday began reviewing the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol over his Dec. 3 martial law attempt, starting a process to decide if he will be removed from office, while investigators plan to question him this week.
The court will hold the first public hearing on Dec. 27, spokesperson Lee Jean told a news conference, after the court’s six justices met to discuss plans for reviewing the impeachment by the opposition-controlled parliament on Saturday.
The court has up to six months to decide whether to remove Yoon from office or to reinstate him. The first hearing will be “preparatory” to confirm major legal issues of the case and schedule among other matters, Lee said.
Yoon is not required to attend that hearing, he said.
In 2017, the court took three months to issue a ruling to strip then-President Park Geun-hye’s presidency following her impeachment for abusing the powers of her office.
Yoon and a number of senior officials face potential charges of insurrection, for the short-lived martial law.
A joint team of investigators from the police, the defence ministry and an anti-corruption agency are planning to call Yoon in for questioning at 10 a.m. (0100 GMT) on Wednesday, a police official told Reuters.
Investigators tried to serve a summon for Yoon to appear by delivering it to the presidential office and his official residence, but the presidential security service declined to receive it saying it was not in the position to do so, Yonhap news said.
On Sunday Yoon did not appear in response to a summons for questioning by a separate investigation by the prosecutors’ office, Yonhap news reported. Yoon cited he was still forming a legal team for his defence as the reason, it said.
The government led by acting president, Han Duck-soo, was moving quickly to reassure international partners and calm financial markets, while the main opposition party pledged to cooperate in efforts to stabilize the situation.
Early on Monday, the finance minister, Bank of Korea governor and top financial regulators met and pledged around-the-clock monitoring of financial and foreign exchange markets.
The benchmark KOSPI index .KS11 rose for a fifth straight session on Monday and traded at its highest levels in more than two weeks, as authorities vowed to stabilize financial markets and analysts noted eased political uncertainty.
Yoon’s surprise martial law declaration and the ensuing political crisis spooked markets and South Korea’s diplomatic partners, worried over the country’s ability to deter nuclear-armed North Korea.
In one of his first moves as acting president, Han spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden by telephone on Sunday, pledging unwavering commitment to pursue foreign and security policies based on the alliance between the two countries.
Opposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung welcomed U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of his former intelligence chief to handle special missions including North Korea as a sign of commitment for dialogue to ease tensions.
Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul said the nomination of Richard Grenell indicated North Korea will be one of the top priorities of Trump’s presidency. Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on three occasions during his first term.
The Saturday impeachment vote passed with at least 12 members of Yoon’s ruling People Power Party joining in favour, which has thrown the party into a disarray with its leader Han Dong-hoon announcing his resignation on Monday.

Title: PM Modi calls for collaborative governance and innovation at 4th National Conference of Chief Secretaries
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 06:48:35 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the 4th National Conference of Chief Secretaries on Sunday, highlighting the importance of collaborative governance for realizing the vision of Viksit Bharat. The three-day conference, which took place from December 13 to 15, brought together officials from all states and Union Territories, along with experts and senior officers from the central government.
In his speech, Prime Minister Modi emphasized that the greatest benefit of the conference was the opportunity for “Team India” to engage in open dialogue and work together toward the common goal of a developed nation. He underlined that Pro-People Pro-active Good Governance (P2G2) is at the heart of the country’s efforts to achieve the vision of Viksit Bharat.
The conference, centered around the theme of ‘Promoting Entrepreneurship, Employment, and Skilling – Leveraging the Demographic Dividend,’ saw extensive discussions on how to unlock India’s potential by harnessing its demographic advantages. PM Modi praised the rise of start-ups, particularly in smaller Tier 2 and 3 cities, and encouraged states to create an environment conducive to innovation. He urged state governments to identify areas that can support entrepreneurs and take measures to connect them with financial institutions and essential logistics infrastructure.
The Prime Minister also called for the simplification of bureaucratic processes, which he said often lead to the harassment of citizens. He stressed the importance of reforming governance models to promote citizen participation, urging that states focus on reform, perform, and transform while also ensuring that citizens are well-informed about government initiatives.
On the topic of sustainability, Prime Minister Modi highlighted the success of the GOBARdhan programme, which has emerged as a key energy resource by turning waste into wealth. He urged states to explore funding opportunities for the recycling of e-waste, which is expected to rise in the future as India becomes more digitally advanced. By doing so, India can reduce its reliance on imported materials and promote a circular economy.
In the health sector, PM Modi called for greater attention to addressing obesity as part of the Fit India Movement, noting that only a fit and healthy population can contribute to building a Viksit Bharat. He also expressed confidence that India could eliminate tuberculosis by the end of 2025 and emphasized the important role that ASHA and Anganwadi workers would play in achieving this goal.
The Prime Minister also spoke about the need to digitize India’s ancient manuscripts, calling them a treasure that should be preserved through technology. He further emphasized the importance of continuously updating the PM GatiShakti platform to include indicators related to environmental impacts and disaster-prone areas, ensuring that India’s infrastructure growth remains sustainable.
PM Modi also lauded the Aspirational Districts and Blocks Programme, stressing that the right officers posted in these areas could bring about significant socio-economic changes. He called for focused human resources development to transform cities into hubs of economic growth, underscoring the importance of urban governance, water management, and adequate housing to support the increasing urban mobility.
Paying tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his death anniversary, PM Modi hailed Patel as an inspiration for civil servants and urged them to work towards realizing his vision for a united and strong India. He also encouraged citizens to draw inspiration from the freedom movement and work towards making India a Viksit Bharat by 2047, just as they came together for independence.
The conference sessions delved into several key themes, including manufacturing, services, renewable energy, and circular economy, with a strong emphasis on women-led development as a driving force for economic transformation. Experts discussed a multifaceted approach to harnessing the potential of India’s service sector, particularly in smaller cities, and promoted rural entrepreneurship through targeted skilling programs.
A key focus of the discussions was the PRAGATI platform, designed to accelerate infrastructure development through rigorous monitoring and reviews. A special session on Frontier Technologies examined how technological convergence could provide solutions to global challenges while positioning India as a leader in inclusive and sustainable growth. Another special session, Karmayogi, focused on capacity building for civil servants, highlighting the importance of democratizing learning and strengthening citizen-centric programs.

Title: Bangladesh elections likely between late 2025 or early 2026: Dr Yunus
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 06:14:54 +0000
Content: The head of Interim Government of Bangladesh Dr Muhammad Yunus today said the next general election can be held in between the end of 2025 and the first half of 2026 after accomplishing necessary reforms.
“Broadly speaking, the election date can be set between the end of 2025 and the first half of 2026,” he said while addressing the nation this morning, marking the Victory Day. Bangladesh Television and BTV World broadcast the address of Dr Yunus.
Yunus emphasised that the timeline for the elections depends on the recommendations of the Electoral Reform Commission and the Constitution Reform Commission, which are currently conducting evaluations.
Morevere, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), one of the major political parties of Bangladesh, has been creating pressure for the last three months on Yunus led interim government for the Election roadmap. BNP’s acting chairperson Tarique Rahman said on Sunday that people had the right to know how many more months would be needed for the interim government to reform the state. He said that if the advisers’ faces turned gloomy when asked about the election roadmap, it certainly was a sign of going against the people’s aspirations.
Earlier, BangladeshPresident Mohammed Shahabuddin today paid rich tributes to the martyrs of the 1971 Liberation War by placing a wreath at the National Memorial here, on the outskirts of Dhaka, marking the 54th Victory Day as the country was liberated from the Pakistani occupation forces.
Dr Muhammad Yunus and President of Timor-Leste Jose Ramos-Horta, who is on a state visit to Bangladesh today paid rich tributes to the martyrs by placing wreaths at the National Memorial.
The High Commission of India in Bangladesh also extended its greetings to the people of Bangladesh. It said that the Vijay Diwas symbolises the strong bonds of friendship between India and Bangladesh which is made eternal by the shared sacrifices of Muktijoddhas and Indian soldiers who shed their blood to liberate Bangladesh from oppression and atrocities.
On this day in 1971, the Pakistani armed forces led by General A A K Niazi had surrendered before the Indian army and the Mukti-Bahini liberation force of Bangladesh with over 90,000 of his troops.

Title: Bangladesh celebrates Victory Day, commemorating liberation from Pakistani in 1971
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 06:01:00 +0000
Content: Bangladesh is set to celebrate the Victory Day today, the most precious day of the Bangladeshis, on December 16 as the country was liberated from the Pakistani occupation forces on that day in 1971 after a nine-month-long bloodstained War of Liberation. The nation would take a renewed pledge to translate into reality the hopes and aspirations of the War of Liberation and the dreams of the martyrs who made supreme sacrifices to liberate their beloved motherland from the Pakistani occupation forces in 1971.
Tens of thousands of people belonging to different social groups and political, cultural, professional and academic organizations and institutions are expected to throng the National Monument at Savar, near Dhaka, to pay homage to the heroes who embraced martyrdom to liberate the nation.
President Muhammad Sahabuddin is to be the first to offer wreaths at the monument amid a ceremonial honour guard while Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus is to follow him.
Political parties, socio-cultural and professional organizations and academic institutions are expected to follow them to place wreaths at the memorial.
A 31-gun salute will herald the Victory Day celebrations recalling the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent nation on the world map with the surrender of Pakistani forces.
To commemorate the Liberation War of 1971, India and Bangladesh invite each other’s War Veterans and serving officers to participate annually in each other’s Victory Day celebrations, said the High Commission of India in Bangladesh through an official facebook post.
On the 53th anniversary of the Liberation War, eight valiant Muktijoddhas and two serving officers of Bangladesh Armed Forces departed for India on Sunday to participate in Vijay Diwas celebrations at Kolkata. Similarly, eight Indian War Veterans and two serving officers of Indian Armed Forces reached Dhaka to participate in Bangladesh’s Victory Day celebrations, said the High Commission.
These bilateral visits provide a platform for Bangladesh Muktijoddhas and Indian War Veterans to celebrate the unique friendship of the two countries and to renew memories of the Liberation War. This memory epitomises the shared sacrifices of the armed forces of India and Bangladesh for the cause of Bangladesh’s freedom from occupation, oppression and mass atrocities, said the High Commission.
On this day in 1971, the Pakistani armed forces led by General A A K Niazi had surrendered before the Indian army and the Mukti-Bahini liberation force of Bangladesh with over 90,000 of his troops.

Title: China’s fragile recovery: industrial gains, sluggish retail, and stimulus pressure as U.S. tariffs loom
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 06:00:03 +0000
Content: China’s industrial output growth quickened slightly in November, while retail sales disappointed, keeping pressure on Beijing to ramp up stimulus for a fragile economy as it braces for more U.S. trade tariffs under a second Trump administration.
The mixed set of data underlines the challenges facing Chinese leaders heading into 2025 when trade relations with the United States could worsen at a time when domestic consumption also remains weak.
“China’s economy appears to have slowed last month, despite tailwinds from recent policy easing,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics.
“But we doubt that stimulus can deliver anything more than a short-lived improvement, not least because the current strength of export demand is unlikely to last once President Trump starts to put some of his tariff threats into action.”
China’s industrial output grew 5.4% in November year-on-year, up from the 5.3% pace seen in October, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Monday, beating expectations for a 5.3% increase in a Reuters poll.
However, retail sales, a gauge of consumption, grew just 3.3% last month, much slower than a 4.8% rise seen in October. Analysts had predicted a 4.6% expansion.
The weaker retail figures come despite a boost from major online shopping promotions and government-subsidised trade-in programs that have boosted sales in sectors including automobiles.
Fixed asset investment also increased at a slower 3.3% pace in January-November from the same period a year earlier, compared with an expected 3.4% rise. It grew 3.4% in the January to October period.
NBS spokesperson Fu Linghui told a media briefing that the trend of recovery in consumption has not changed and that more efforts would be needed to ensure the economic recovery continues into 2025.
At last week’s Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC), a closely-watched agenda-setting meeting, China’s top leaders pledged to raise the budget deficit, issue more debt, and make boosting consumption a top priority.
The remarks echoed commitments made by a meeting of top Communist Party officials, the Politburo, earlier this month, which endorsed an “appropriately loose” monetary policy in the first easing of its stance in 14 years.
Policymakers continue to grapple with a years-long property crisis that is dragging on consumer confidence and the broader economy, with some 70% of household savings parked in real estate.
There was some encouraging signs on China’s new home prices, which fell at the slowest pace in 17 months in November.
Officials in recent months have doubled down on efforts to encourage homebuying, including cutting mortgage rates and minimum down-payment ratios, as well as tax incentives to lower the cost of housing transactions.
However, most analysts say a sure-footed recovery in the real estate sector appears to be some way off.
Reuters has reported that policy advisers have recommended that Beijing maintain a growth target of around 5.0% for next year, with one government economist saying that China can offset the impact of expected U.S. tariffs on its exports by further boosting domestic demand.
Trump, who is set to start his second term as the U.S. president in January, has threatened tariffs in excess of 60% on imports of Chinese goods.
Reuters also reported last week that China was considering allowing the yuan to weaken in response to punitive trade measures, but a readout from state media Xinhua after the CEWC reiterated a commitment to maintain the yuan’s basic stability.
A recent Reuters poll predicted China will grow 4.5% next year, with new U.S. tariffs potentially shaving up to 1 parentage point off growth.

Title: Indian share market opens lower, auto and IT stocks drag
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 05:45:05 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market opened in the red on Monday, with selling pressure observed in Nifty’s auto, IT, PSU bank, pharma, and metal sectors.
At around 9:32 am, the Sensex was trading at 81,876.95, down by 256.17 points or 0.31%, while the Nifty was at 24,705.60, declining by 62.70 points or 0.25%.
Despite the decline, the market trend remained broadly positive. On the National Stock Exchange (NSE), 1,170 stocks were trading in the green, while 571 stocks were in the red.
Akshay Chinchalkar of Axis Securities commented on Friday’s highly volatile session, stating that the Nifty slumped during the early part of the session, “but the day’s low occurred exactly at the falling neckline of the bullish head-and-shoulders pattern, which was activated on December 3 with an upside objective of 25,500.”
He added, “This objective remains valid as long as the market stays above 23,873, but more critical support now is Friday’s low of 24,180.”
Nifty Bank was down 168 points or 0.31%, trading at 53,415.80. The Nifty Midcap 100 index rose by 243.30 points or 0.41%, trading at 59,234.85, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 index was up 108.10 points or 0.56%, at 19,515.40.
According to market experts, the heightened volatility in the market can be attributed to large positions in the F&O (Futures & Options) segments. The 500-point move in the Nifty from the day’s trough to its peak suggests massive short-covering activity.
In the Sensex pack, NTPC, JSW Steel, M&M, Titan, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Infosys, TCS, Hindustan Unilever Limited, Axis Bank, and Tech Mahindra were among the top losers. On the other hand, Tata Steel, UltraTech Cement, L&T, ITC, Tata Motors, IndusInd Bank, and HCL Tech emerged as the top gainers.
In Asian markets, except for China, indices in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Seoul, Jakarta, and Japan were trading in the red.
Meanwhile, in the US stock markets, the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.12% higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.20% lower in the previous trading session.
Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) bought equities worth Rs 2,335.32 crore on December 13, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) sold equities worth Rs 732.20 crore on the same day.

Title: Israel approves $11.13 million settlement expansion in Golan Heights
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 05:39:35 +0000
Content: The Israeli government has unanimously approved a comprehensive plan to expand settlements in the occupied Golan Heights, allocating more than $11.13 million to the initiative. The decision, announced Sunday, comes amid heightened regional tensions following recent political upheaval in Syria.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who proposed the plan, cited security concerns along Israel’s border with Syria as justification, pointing to what he called a “new front” following the fall of the Assad regime this month. The expansion initiative includes funding for education, renewable energy projects, a student village, and organizational development support for the Golan Regional Council to accommodate an influx of new residents.
Currently, the occupied Syrian Golan Heights has a population of approximately 50,000, evenly split between Israeli settlers and a mix of Druze, Alawite, and other communities. The new plan aims to significantly increase the Israeli settler presence in the region.
The announcement has triggered swift condemnation from multiple Arab nations. The United Arab Emirates denounced the decision through its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reaffirming its commitment to Syria’s territorial integrity and warning of potential regional escalation. Qatar characterized the move as “a new chapter in a series of Israeli attacks on Syrian territories,” urging international intervention to halt the expansion. Saudi Arabia added its voice to the growing opposition, explicitly condemning the settlement plan.
The Golan Heights, captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War and annexed in 1981, remains classified as occupied territory under international law. The United States stands alone in recognizing Israel’s annexation of the region, with the international community broadly rejecting Israeli sovereignty over the area.

Title: Israeli forces carry out air, ground attacks in Gaza; dozens dead
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 05:26:59 +0000
Content: Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 53 Palestinians, including a journalist and rescue workers, medics said, and the Israeli military said its air and ground forces in the north of the enclave killed dozens of militants and captured others.
An airstrike hit the civil emergency centre in the Nuseirat market area in the central Gaza Strip, killing Ahmed Al-Louh, a video journalist for Al Jazeera TV, and five other people, medics and fellow journalists said. Another strike on a house in Nuseirat camp killed five people, including children, according to medics.
The TV network said Al-Louh was working when he was killed and condemned Israel.
The Israeli military said the strike had targeted Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants operating from Gaza’s Civil Defence’s Nuseirat office. It named Al-Louh as a member of the militant group Islamic Jihad, without providing evidence.
Al Jazeera did not immediately comment on the Israeli allegation but has condemned previous claims by Israel naming some of the Qatari-owned network’s journalists killed in the Gaza war as members of militant groups.
Hamas media said the head of the civil emergency service in Nuseirat, Nedal Abu Hjayyer, was also killed.
“The civil emergency headquarters in Nuseirat camp was hit during the crews’ presence, they work around the clock to serve the people,” said Zaki Emadeldeen from the civil emergency service to reporters at the hospital.
Another airstrike hit a group of Hamas-linked men tasked with protecting aid trucks west of Gaza City, and medics said several were hurt but exact figures were unavailable.
At least 11 people were killed in three Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City houses, nine were killed in the towns of Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia camp when clusters of houses were bombed or set ablaze, and two were killed in Rafah, medics and residents said.
The Israeli military said the three Gaza City houses belonged to militants planning imminent attacks. It said steps were taken to reduce risk to civilians, including the use of precise munitions and aerial surveillance.
The military issued a photo showing the weapons it seized in Beit Lahiya that included explosives and dozens of grenades.
In southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, medics said that at least 20 people, including women and children, were killed when an airstrike hit a shelter housing displaced families.
In Beit Hanoun, residents said Israeli forces besieged families sheltering in Khalil Aweida school before storming it and ordering them to head towards Gaza City.
Medics said several people were killed and wounded during the raid while the army detained many men.
The military said it struck dozens of militants from the air and on the ground and captured others in Beit Hanoun.
Reuters was unable to confirm whether any of the people killed were fighters. Hamas does not disclose its casualties, and the Palestinian health ministry does not distinguish in its death toll between combatants and non-combatants.
Israel says Gaza’s militants regularly embed among civilians, using them as human shields. Hamas denies this.
HOSTAGES
Separately, Israel said aircraft struck a command and control centre in a compound in the Abu Shabak clinic in northern Gaza used by Hamas to store weapons and plan attacks. The Gaza health ministry said the medical center was destroyed.
Palestinians accuse Israel of carrying out ethnic cleansing to depopulate Gaza’s northern edge to create a buffer zone. Israel denies this and says the campaign targets Hamas militants. The military says it has instructed civilians to evacuate battle zones for their own safety.
The war began when the Palestinian militant group Hamas stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel then launched an air and land offensive that has killed almost 45,000 people, mostly civilians, according to authorities in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. The campaign has displaced nearly the entire population and left much of the enclave in ruins.
A bid by Egypt, Qatar and the United States to reach a truce, which would also include a hostage deal, has gained momentum in recent weeks, yet there has been no news of a breakthrough.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had spoken with U.S. President-elect Trump, who returns to the White House on Jan. 20, about efforts to secure a hostage release.
“We discussed the need to complete Israel’s victory and we spoke at length about the efforts we are making to free our hostages,” Netanyahu said in a statement on Sunday.

Title: Rajya Sabha to hold discussion on Constitution from today
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 05:16:26 +0000
Content: After a fiery debate over the Constitution in the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha is set to discuss the topic on Monday and Tuesday.
As per the list of business of the Upper House, there will be a “discussion on the glorious journey of the 75 years of the Constitution of India”.
Before the discussion begins, an obituary reference will be made on the passing away of ex-Member Shreegopal Vyas, papers will be laid on the table by eight ministers, and various Standing Committees will also submit their reports.
The debate in the Rajya Sabha comes amid escalating tensions over a no-confidence motion filed by the Congress-led opposition against Vice President and House Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar.
Last week, the Upper House saw uproar and adjournments over the no-trust motion against Dhankhar. The opposition’s motion accuses him of biased conduct.
The Rajya Sabha debate on the Constitution comes after a two-day discussion in the Lok Sabha. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh initiated the two-day debate with a focus on its historical significance and role in shaping the nation’s governance and global standing.
Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in her maiden speech in Parliament, said the BJP would have changed the Constitution had it not been for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi made references to Veer Savarkar which were objected to by the BJP members.
The highlight of the two-day discussion in the Lower House was Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech. He said the Constitutional amendments brought by his government weren’t done to tighten grip on power, in contrast with the Congress. He said the Nehru-Gandhi family had made a habit of amending the Constitution as it suited their interests, starting with the country’s first PM Jawaharlal Nehru.
PM Modi also outlined 11 resolutions for the country’s future. He said, “After being inspired by the inherent spirit of the Constitution, I want to present 11 resolutions in front of the Parliament for the future of the country.”

Title: Centre receives Rs 8,625 crore as disinvestment receipts so far in 2024-25
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 12:49:47 +0000
Content: The government has received Rs 8,625 crore through disinvestment receipts during the financial year 2024-25, with these funds raised through various minority stake sale transactions, MoS Finance Pankaj Chaudhary informed in a written reply to the Lok Sabha.
In response to a query on disinvestment targets over the last five years, the minister said that the government stopped setting specific disinvestment targets beginning in the 2023-24 financial year. For 2024-25, no disinvestment estimate or target has been set.
“So far, the Government has received Rs. 8,625 crore through various minority stake sale disinvestment transactions during the current financial year,” the minister said.
The government typically conducts disinvestment through minority stake sales and strategic disinvestments of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs).
Strategic disinvestment involves the full or substantial sale of government shareholding in a CPSE along with the transfer of management control. In the case of privatization, the government’s equity and management control in a CPSE are transferred to a private buyer, while in other instances, equity is transferred to another CPSE along with control.
“The policy on strategic disinvestment/privatization is based on the economic principle that Government should discontinue in sectors, where competitive markets have come of age and economic potential of such entities may be better discovered in the hands of strategic investor due to various factors such as infusion of capital, technological upgradation and efficient management practices,” the minister added.
Profitability or loss is, however, not among the relevant criteria for privatization or strategic disinvestment.
Disinvestment is an ongoing process, and execution/completion of specific transactions hinges upon market conditions, domestic and global economic outlook, geopolitical factors, investor interest and administrative feasibility.
The government, since 2016, has given ‘in-principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment of 36 cases of PSEs and/or Subsidiaries/Units/Joint Ventures of PSEs/Bank.

Title: GRAP stage III re-imposed in Delhi amid ‘very poor’ air quality
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 11:52:45 +0000
Content: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Monday imposed Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi after the city’s air quality deteriorated to the ‘very poor’ category.
The CAQM attributed the sharp decline in air quality to “highly unfavorable meteorological conditions,” which have exacerbated pollution levels.
The CAQM introduced a revised version of GRAP on December 13 to address the recurring problem of winter pollution in Delhi-NCR. GRAP is a set of emergency measures aimed at curbing pollution levels, implemented progressively depending on air quality severity. With calm winds and low mixing height exacerbating pollution levels, the CAQM stated that immediate action was necessary to mitigate the health risks posed by the deteriorating air quality.
In a statement, the CAQM said, “Considering the highly unfavourable meteorological conditions, including calm winds and very low mixing height, leading the AQI of Delhi into the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category, the CAQM Sub-Committee on GRAP has decided to impose Stage III with immediate effect in the entire NCR.”
The reimposition of Stage III introduces stricter measures across sectors to combat pollution. Schools and colleges in Delhi and adjoining areas, including Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and Gautam Budh Nagar, will switch to hybrid learning for students up to Class V, enabling online education for those who opt for it.
To curb vehicular emissions, restrictions on inter-state buses entering Delhi will be tightened, permitting only electric, CNG, or BS-VI diesel vehicles. The Delhi government has also been instructed to ban diesel medium goods vehicles (MGVs) with BS-IV or older standards, except those carrying essential goods, within city limits. Non-essential diesel light commercial vehicles (LCVs) of BS-IV or older standards registered outside Delhi will also face restrictions.
The revised GRAP mandates additional responsibilities for Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs), which will now be required to provide electric heaters for workers such as sanitation staff and security personnel to discourage open burning of biomass or waste during the winter months.
Acknowledging the challenges faced by persons with disabilities, exemptions have been introduced for them from restrictions on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles in Delhi and nearby districts.

Title: Won’t allow our land to be used in any manner that is detrimental to India’s interest: Lankan President Dissanayake
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 11:36:24 +0000
Content: Thanking India for its “immense support” during the unprecedented economic crisis, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Monday assured Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he will not allow the island nation to be used in any way that is detrimental to the interest of India.
“I have given an assurance to the Prime Minister of India that we will not allow our land to be used in any way in a manner that is detrimental to the interest of India. The cooperation with India will certainly flourish and I want to reassure our continued support to India,” Dissanayake said after holding discussions with PM Modi at New Delhi’s Hyderabad House.
Dissanayake, who arrived in India on Sunday evening on his first foreign visit after assuming office, expressed his gratitude to President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Modi for support and warm hospitality, emphasising that the ongoing visit has paved the way for further development of cooperation between the two neighbouring countries.
“We faced an unprecedented economic crisis two years ago and India supported us immensely to come out of that quagmire. It has also helped us immensely after that, especially in the debt-free structuring process. I know that Sri Lanka secures a very significant place in the foreign policy of India. PM Modi assured us full support and he also assured us that he will always protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Sri Lanka,” said the visiting President.
PM Modi during press conference said that he has assured the Lankan President that India will remain a trusted and reliable partner in Sri Lanka’s development efforts.
“We completely agree that our security interests are interlinked. We have decided to finalise the Defence Cooperation Agreement soon. Cooperation on hydrography has also been agreed upon. We believe that the Colombo Security Conclave is an important platform for regional peace, security and development. Under this, cooperation will be enhanced on topics like maritime security, counter-terrorism, cyber-security, fight against smuggling and organised crime, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The people-to-people relations between India and Sri Lanka are linked to our civilisations,” PM Modi said.
PM Modi said that both sides also had a detailed discussion on the issues related to the livelihood of fishermen.
While Prime Minister Modi suggested moving forward with a “humane approach” in the matter, Dissanayake said that a “durable and sustainable” solution is needed on the issue, that he said has become a “plague” for both the countries.
“There are bottom trawling systems being adopted by the fishermen in that area and that needs to be put an end to because that will spell doom to this industry,” he said.
The Lankan President lauded India’s “tremendous success” in digitising the public services and remarked that Sri Lanka is also taking the same path with PM Modi assuring him of support in the endeavour.
Dissanayake is also scheduled to meet Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar and participate in a business forum aimed at strengthening investment and trade ties between the two countries before travelling to Bodh Gaya.
The visiting delegation also includes Vijitha Herath – Sri Lanka’s Foreign Affairs, Overseas Employment, and Tourism Minister and the country’s Minister of Labour and Deputy Economic Development Minister Anil Jayanta Fernando.
Soon after his arrival on Sunday, the Lankan President had met with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval.
“Extensive discussions were held between President Dissanayake and Minister Sitharaman on enhancing Indo-Sri Lankan economic cooperation and expanding investment opportunities between the two countries. The talks also covered bringing more Indian tourists to Sri Lanka, modernizing Sri Lanka’s agriculture sector, and developing digital infrastructure,” the Lankan President’s office said in a statement on Monday.

Title: Amit Shah lauds Chhattisgarh govt for action against Maoists
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 11:27:02 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday commended the Chhattisgarh government for its determined efforts in combating Maoism in the state.
Addressing a gathering in Jagdalpur, Shah praised the collaborative approach adopted by the state government and central agencies to tackle the issue effectively.
During his visit, Shah met with surrendered Maoists and their families, offering support and reassurance. He reiterated the government’s commitment to assisting those affected by the violence and emphasized the need for collective action to eradicate Maoism from the region.
“The Central government, in collaboration with the Chhattisgarh government, will ensure comprehensive support to the families impacted by Maoism. I appeal to everyone to join hands with the ongoing campaigns by both governments to eradicate this menace,” he said.
Shah highlighted the progress made in the past year, pointing to the reduction in Maoist activities and the neutralization of several top cadres. He credited the Chhattisgarh government’s leadership and strategic approach for the improvements, expressing confidence that Maoism will be eliminated from the country by March 31, 2026.
Shah also praised the leadership of Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai, Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma, and the tireless efforts of state police and security forces. “The combined efforts of the Chhattisgarh government, police, and security agencies have laid a strong foundation for this campaign. I assure you all that the goal of a Maoism-free state will be realised within the set timeline,” he said.
The Home Minister highlighted various initiatives, including the signing of 20 peace accords in the northeast and the surrender of 9,000 militants. He also mentioned that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had approved 15,000 homes for surrendered Maoists under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, and the National Dairy Development Board would provide cows or buffaloes to help such families earn Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 per month.
In a post on X, HM said, “Maoism not only deprived the country’s large population of their fundamental rights for decades but also crossed all limits of inhumanity and adversely affected their lives. Maoists, who sow seeds of fear and greed in the minds of youth and lead them on the path of violence, are the biggest enemies of society. Our government under the leadership of Modiji is committed to the empowerment and all-round development of Maoist-affected people and the youth who have given up violence and joined the mainstream.”

Title: Strong kharif and rabi crop outlook eases India’s food inflation concerns
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 11:14:55 +0000
Content: The arrival of kharif crops in the market, coupled with a robust outlook for the rabi crop, bodes well for the food inflation outlook, economists said on Monday.
This positive sentiment comes as the wholesale price index (WPI) inflation eased to 1.9 percent in November, down from 2.4 percent in October.
The moderation in WPI inflation last month was primarily driven by a decline in food inflation.
“The arrival of fresh harvests has led to a seasonal correction in food prices,” said Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist at CareEdge Ratings.
“The outlook for agriculture remains positive, with good kharif production and conducive prospects for rabi sowing, thanks to healthy reservoir levels and good soil moisture from prolonged monsoons.”
Sinha added, “We expect WPI inflation to remain largely benign, averaging 2.3 percent in Q3 FY25 and around 2.5 percent for the full fiscal year.”
The WPI moderation was primarily led by a decline in primary food articles, which eased to a three-month low of 8.6 percent from 13.5 percent in the previous month. This exerted significant downward pressure on the headline inflation rate.
“Core (non-food manufacturing) WPI inflation inched up to 0.5 percent in November 2024 from 0.3 percent in October 2024, but remained below 1.0 percent for the fourth consecutive month,” noted Rahul Agrawal, Senior Economist at ICRA.
This easing in inflation is a welcome sign, especially since retail inflation crossed the RBI’s upper limit of 6 percent for the first time in October.
The central bank is waiting for retail inflation to stabilize at 4 percent before considering an interest rate cut to propel growth, which is widely anticipated early next year.

Title: Sensex Ends Lower, Nifty Bank Flat as Investors Await Fed Decision
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 11:03:35 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market closed lower on Monday amid mixed global cues.
At closing, the Sensex settled at 81,748.57, down by 384.55 points, or 0.47 percent, and the Nifty ended at 24,668.25, down by 100.05 points, or 0.40 percent.
The national market traded in a range-bound manner, while the realty sector outperformed in expectation of growing demand and a potential rate cut cycle in 2025, market experts said. A rise in manufacturing and service PMI suggests a positive turnaround in H2 FY25 earnings, which may limit further downgrades in FY25 earnings.
“Rising US 10-year bond yields and a strengthening dollar led investors to remain watchful of the upcoming US Fed policy and its commentary for 2025 rates,” the experts added.
The Nifty Bank ended at 53,581.35, down by 2.45 points, or 0.00 percent. The Nifty Midcap 100 index closed at 59,443 at the end of trading after rising 451.50 points, or 0.77 percent. The Nifty Smallcap 100 index closed at 19,531.05 after rising 123.75 points, or 0.64 percent.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), 2,338 shares ended in the green and 1,802 in the red, while 100 shares remained unchanged.
On the sectoral front, buying was witnessed in the auto, PSU bank, pharma, realty, media, and private bank sectors of the Nifty.
In the Sensex pack, Titan, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, TCS, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Infosys, Hindustan Unilever, JSW Steel, HCL Tech, Tata Steel, Tata Motors, HDFC Bank, and Nestle India were the top losers. IndusInd Bank, Bajaj Finance, Power Grid, M&M, and Axis Bank were the top gainers.
The market is currently awaiting the US Federal Reserve (FED) meeting scheduled for December 17-18. The rupee traded at 84.87 as the dollar strengthened, holding above the $106.50 mark. The rupee’s trading range is expected to remain between 84.75 and 85.00 amid these developments, experts said.

Title: India and Sri Lanka sign key MoUs to strengthen bilateral ties
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 11:01:19 +0000
Content: India and Sri Lanka signed several Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) in New Delhi on Monday, aimed at expanding cooperation across multiple sectors. The agreements were signed in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who is on a three-day state visit to India.
During a joint press conference, PM Modi highlighted India’s ongoing support to Sri Lanka, saying that India has provided $5 billion in lines of credit and grant assistance to the island nation.
“We have cooperation in all 25 districts of Sri Lanka, and the selection of our projects is always based on the development priorities of the partner countries,” PM Modi said.
One of the key outcomes of the discussions was the decision to expedite a defence cooperation agreement between the two nations. PM Modi emphasized that both India and Sri Lanka recognize that their security interests are interlinked.
“We completely agree that our security interests are interlinked. We have decided to conclude the defence cooperation agreement soon. Cooperation on hydrography has also been agreed upon. We believe that the Colombo Security Conclave is an important platform for regional peace, security and development. Under this, cooperation will be enhanced on topics like maritime security, counter-terrorism, cyber-security, fight against smuggling and organised crime, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief,” PM Modi said.
Economic cooperation was another major focus, with both leaders underscoring the importance of investment-led growth and connectivity. PM Modi highlighted plans to strengthen physical, digital, and energy connectivity as the pillars of the partnership.
“Work will be done for establishing electricity grid connectivity and multi petroleum pipeline. Pace will be given to Sampur Solar Power Plant. LNG will be supplied for Sri Lankan Power plants. To boost bilateral trade, both sides will try to conclude the Ekta soon, ” PM Modi said.
PM Modi also outlined plans for the rehabilitation of key infrastructure, including the signalling system for the Maho-Anuradhapura railway section and the development of Kankesanthurai Port.
In education, starting next year, India will offer monthly scholarships to 200 students from universities in Jaffna and the Eastern Province. Furthermore, 1,500 Sri Lankan civil servants will receive training in India over the next five years.
India’s cooperation with Sri Lanka will also extend to sectors such as housing, renewable energy, agriculture, dairy, and fisheries. In addition, India will participate in Sri Lanka’s unique digital identity project.
PM Modi highlighted the deep cultural connections between the two countries, noting that when the Pali language was recognized as a “Classical Language” in India, it was celebrated in Sri Lanka as well.
Dissanayake’s state visit, which runs from December 15 to 17, marks his first bilateral visit to India since assuming office in September.

Title: India’s banking sector set for continued resilience amid strong economic growth: S&P Global
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 10:49:36 +0000
Content: India’s financial sector is set for continued resilience, driven by structural improvements and strong economic growth, according to S&P Global Ratings’ 2025 banking outlook.
“We expect asset quality to stabilize, with weak loans projected to decline to around 3.0% of gross loans by March 2025. This is supported by healthy corporate balance sheets and improved risk management,” said Deepali Seth-Chhabria, Analyst at S&P Global Ratings.
While underwriting standards for retail loans remain strong and delinquencies manageable, the rapid growth of unsecured personal loans may pose some risks.
S&P Global expects loan growth to slightly exceed nominal GDP, particularly in the retail segment, though deposit growth may lag, potentially affecting credit-to-deposit ratios.
Credit costs are expected to normalize from a decade-low of 0.8% in fiscal 2024 to a range of 0.8%-0.9%. Despite this, profitability should remain strong, with returns on average assets projected around 1.2% in fiscal 2025, she added.
The Reserve Bank of India’s increased regulatory oversight on compliance and governance may raise compliance costs but will ultimately enhance financial stability. Overall, the outlook for India’s financial sector remains stable as it adapts to these changes, the report concluded.
A recent RBI report also noted that the Indian financial system remains resilient, benefiting from broader macroeconomic stability.
The banking sector is well-capitalized, reflecting improved risk absorption, while the NBFC sector and Urban Cooperative Banks also show progress.
RBI Deputy Governor M. Rajeshwar Rao recently highlighted that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has been crucial in improving bank asset quality and facilitating pre-admission debt settlements exceeding Rs 10 lakh crore since its introduction in 2016, further strengthening banks.

Title: Australia dominate India amidst rain interruptions on day three in Brisbane
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 10:29:57 +0000
Content: Australia’s pacemen rattled through India’s top order on a rain-hit day three of the third test in Brisbane on Monday but the recurring wet weather put the brakes on the hosts’ charge.
India were 51 for four at stumps, trailing Australia’s first-innings total by 394 runs, as play was abandoned nearly an hour early due to bad light at the Gabba.
Opener KL Rahul was unbeaten on 33 with India skipper Rohit Sharma yet to score.
Australia’s bowlers could send down only 17 overs after being bowled out for 445 in the morning. Captain Pat Cummins did well to have Rishabh Pant caught behind for nine in the first over following a rain break before tea.
Two balls later, following a glorious cover drive for four by Rahul off Mitchell Starc, the players trudged off the ground as tea was called early.
More rain saw the resumption of play delayed after tea and when it finally kicked off again Australia were reduced to bowling only a couple of overs of spin due to poor light after paceman Starc had completed his earlier interrupted over.
It was a frustrating day for the loyal crowd of 16,180 but perhaps more so for the home team, whose chances of forcing a result were progressively eroded.
Adding to the angst, there is more rain forecast for days four and five.
Australia, nonetheless, dominated what play there was, continuing on from their superb day two when Travis Head and Steve Smith scored centuries to build a big total.
Starc took two wickets in six balls with the help of namesake Mitchell Marsh, while Josh Hazlewood removed Virat Kohli as India’s reply got off to a dreadful start.
Starc struck with the second ball of the innings, Yashasvi Jaiswal flicking a shot off his pads to be out for four, with Marsh jogging across from square leg to take an easy catch.
Big left-armer Starc then dismissed Shubman Gill for one as the number three drove at a full delivery to send a thick edge to Marsh, who leapt to his left in the gully to take a screamer of a catch.
Kohli lasted only 16 balls for his three runs, nibbling at a Hazlewood delivery to be caught behind.
Rahul survived, though, after wearing a painful blow on his wrist from Hazlewood’s first ball of the morning.
The hosts resumed in the morning on 405 for seven, adding 40 runs for their last three wickets.
Wicketkeeper Alex Carey contributed a valuable 70 before caught slogging, becoming recalled paceman Akash Deep’s first and only wicket of the innings.
Jasprit Bumrah finished with 6-76, adding Starc to his haul after the tailender made a useful 18, while Mohammed Siraj bowled Nathan Lyon for two to finish with 2-97.
The five-match series is tied at 1-1 with two matches to come in Melbourne and Sydney.

Title: India’s total exports rise to $67.8 billion in November
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 17:07:47 +0000
Content: India’s total exports, including merchandise and services, reached $67.79 billion in November 2024, reflecting a 9.59 percent growth compared to November 2023, according to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
Merchandise exports during April-November 2024 totaled $284.31 billion, a 2.17 percent increase from $278.26 billion during the same period in 2023. However, merchandise exports for November 2024 amounted to $32.11 billion, down from $33.75 billion in November 2023, mainly due to reduced petroleum exports. Non-petroleum merchandise exports in November 2024 stood at $28.40 billion, marking a 7.75 percent growth from $26.36 billion in November 2023.
Key contributors to export growth in November 2024 included electronic goods, engineering goods, rice, marine products, and ready-made garments. Electronic goods exports rose by 54.72 percent, reaching $3.47 billion from $2.24 billion in November 2023. Engineering goods exports grew by 13.75 percent to $8.90 billion from $7.82 billion, while rice exports nearly doubled to $1.14 billion from $0.59 billion. Marine product exports increased to $0.76 billion, and ready-made garment exports reached $1.12 billion.
Total imports, including merchandise and services, for November 2024 were estimated at $87.63 billion, representing a 27.47 percent increase from November 2023. Gold imports for the month peaked at $14.8 billion. Total imports for April-November 2024 were estimated at $619.20 billion, reflecting a 9.55 percent rise.
The merchandise trade deficit widened to $37.84 billion in November 2024 from $27.14 billion, driven by the rise in gold imports.

Title: German parliament votes no-confidence in Chancellor Scholz, paving way for election

Content: The German parliament accepted Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s invitation to withdraw its confidence in him and his government on Monday, clearing the way for the Feb. 23 early election necessitated by the collapse of his government.
Scholz’s three-party coalition fell apart last month after the pro-market Free Democrats quit in a row over debt, leaving his Social Democrats and the Greens without a parliamentary majority just when Germany faces adeepening economic crisis.
Under rules designed to prevent the instability that facilitated the rise of fascism in the 1930s, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier can only dissolve parliament and call elections if the chancellor calls, and loses, a confidence vote.
Only 207 of the parliament’s 733 expressed confidence, while 394 withheld it.
“The motion has passed,” said parliament president Baerbel Bas.

Title: Gadhimai Mahotsav Continues to Be the World’s Biggest Animal Slaughter Event
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 16:20:19 +0000
Content: The world’s bloodiest festival continues to face criticism from animal activists campaigning vigorously for decades, but it did not stop more than two crore people from attending Gadhimai Mahotsav this year. This Hindu festival, held once every five years at the Gadhimai Temple in Bariyarpur, Bara district of Madhesh Province, Nepal, near the Indo-Nepal border, started on December 2 and concluded on Shukla Purnima, a Sunday.
The festival features the world’s largest animal sacrifice, occurring on Saptami, Ashtami, and Navami of the Lunar Calendar. Devotees sacrifice water buffaloes, goats, cocks, and ducks, and release doves in the temple premises when they believe their wishes have been fulfilled.
Animal sacrifices commence only after a shaman, as part of the rituals, offers his blood and sacrifices five forest animals: a rat, duck, cock, dove, and boar. According to a priest, a lamp lights up automatically following the shamanic sacrifice, signaling the Goddess’s readiness to accept further offerings. Devotees then proceed with offerings such as buffaloes, goats, cocks, and ducks. In the patriarchal traditions of the Terai and Gangetic belt, devotees often seek blessings for sons, with animal sacrifices made as thanks upon the birth of a boy.
Several NGOs, including Humane Society International, Sneha’s Care, and vegetarianism-promoting civil society groups, have long campaigned against the mass sacrifices during the Gadhimai Mahotsav. In the 2009 festival, over five lakh animals were slaughtered. Locals, however, assert that this practice is a more than 600-year-old ritual and an inviolable part of their faith. Political reluctance to intervene stems from fear of offending religious sentiments.
In 2024, the Supreme Court of India directed state governments to restrict the export and transport of animals intended for sacrifice. Nepal’s Supreme Court ordered a ban on animal sacrifices in 2019, but the ruling remains largely unenforced. Sacrifices now occur behind closed doors to prevent public viewing, with only devotees accompanied by animals permitted into the sacrificial grounds. The animals’ heads are offered to the Goddess, buried by the temple, and the carcasses are auctioned, with the meat frequently exported to China and other countries.
Locals reported a footfall of approximately 2.5 crore people during the 14-day festival, which included entertainment, sports, food stalls, and adventure activities. This inflow significantly boosts tourism, providing local communities with their highest earnings during this period. The substantial revenue generated by the event is a key factor in the lack of political will to discontinue animal sacrifices, as civil societies struggle to oppose these practices without appearing to interfere with deeply rooted religious beliefs.

Title: NDMC to install mist sprayers on electric poles to tackle air pollution
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 15:40:18 +0000
Content: The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has announced plans to install mist sprayers on electric poles as part of efforts to address air pollution. This initiative is aligned with the Ease of Living mission, a program under the government’s urban development agenda, Vice Chairperson Kuljeet Singh Chahal stated on Monday.
According to NDMC, the first phase will see the installation of 15 mist sprayers on electric poles along a 500-meter stretch of Lodhi Road. Each pole will have five nozzles, with six spray holes per nozzle, providing 30 spray points on each pole. The system is designed to use 81 liters of water per pole per hour. Four 5,000-liter capacity tanks will supply treated water from sewage treatment plants (STPs) to avoid the use of fresh water.
The project is expected to begin next year, with the first phase scheduled for completion within a defined timeline. Following its implementation on Lodhi Road, the NDMC plans to expand the project to other areas, including Shanti Path and Africa Avenue, before eventually rolling it out across the jurisdiction.
The NDMC has also deployed Mechanical Road Sweepers (MRS) equipped with GPS tracking to manage road cleaning, with real-time monitoring conducted at the Smart City Integrated Command and Control Centre. Other pollution control measures include the procurement of anti-smog guns and mist spray machines to mitigate dust and particulate matter.
Additionally, water tankers ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 liters in capacity are used for watering roadside greenery, employing treated water to conserve fresh resources. Tree plantation drives and dust control measures at construction sites are also part of NDMC’s efforts to improve air quality.
Chahal reaffirmed NDMC’s commitment to introducing sustainable pollution control strategies to address environmental challenges.

Content: The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has announced a 20% reduction in the prices of textbooks for classes 9 to 12, starting from the upcoming academic year.
NCERT Director Dinesh Prasad Saklani announced at an event on Monday. Saklani stated that this is the first time the prices of textbooks have been substantially reduced.
“This year, NCERT has brought in a lot of efficiency in paper procurement and also onboarded printers with the latest printing machines. NCERT has decided to pass on this benefit to the students of the country,” Saklani said.
He added, “All textbooks of grades 9-12 for the next academic year shall be retailed by NCERT at 20 percent lower price than the existing price. This is unprecedented in the history of NCERT.”
Textbooks for grades 1-8 will continue to be sold at Rs 65 per copy.
The announcement was made during the Bhumi Pujan for the construction of the auditorium at the NCERT Headquarters. Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan presided over the event, where an MoU was also signed between NCERT and Flipkart to increase the availability of NCERT textbooks.
Each year, NCERT prints around 4-5 crore textbooks in approximately 300 titles. Recently, NCERT has expanded its reach by partnering with e-commerce platforms, including Amazon, to facilitate nationwide access to genuine textbooks.

Title: SC agrees to examine PIL for pan-India safety guidelines for women’s protection
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 13:55:49 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking the issuance of pan-India safety guidelines, reforms, and measures for the protection of women.  
A bench led by Justice Surya Kant, along with Justice Ujjal Bhuyan, issued a notice to the Union government, requesting a response on the matter.
The bench said, “We will have to examine where we are lacking to achieve the goal of punitive and penal law. There is not something wrong with the quantity of punishment, but something else.”
The case will be heard again in January 2025.
Senior advocate Mahalakshmi Pavani, representing the Supreme Court Women Lawyers Association, pointed out that despite stringent laws enacted by Parliament, issues like “unwillingness, corruption, and laxity in the police and administrative stakeholders” hinder the timely and effective enforcement of these laws. This, she argued, results in the absence of fear among criminals.
The PIL called on the Supreme Court to take judicial notice and establish strict guidelines with a focus on their time-bound implementation to prevent incidents of sexual violence against women.
Additionally, the plea sought the invocation of the ‘parens patriae’ doctrine to protect the fundamental rights of women, children, and the third gender in India, particularly concerning their rights to safety, dignity, bodily integrity, and a safe environment.
The petition highlighted the surge in crimes against women, girls, and infants, reported across several states such as Kolkata, Delhi, Bihar, Karnataka, Assam, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Odisha, Punjab, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh. It referenced the gangrape and murder of a 31-year-old trainee doctor in Kolkata on August 9, describing it as a “ghastly reminder” that the situation has not improved since the 2012 Nirbhaya case.
“The recent Kolkata gangrape of young lady trainee doctor is only one amongst the many which has highlighted the deep-rooted ineptness, red-tapism, bureaucratic cowardice by the law enforcement agencies, political hooliganism, and the brutal, nefarious and grisly state of affairs concerning the safety of women in India. From Nirbhaya Rape Case to Abhaya, the brutality has only manifested into an animalistic expression against women,” the petition said.
The PIL further noted that the safety of women in India is marred by “ineptness, red-tapism, bureaucratic cowardice by law enforcement agencies, political hooliganism, and brutal behavior from criminals.”
The petition also argued that instead of politicizing such sensitive issues, the government must prioritize the security of vulnerable citizens and increase funds for the safety of women, children, and the third gender.
The PIL emphasized that India often responds to sexual violence only after media trials following traumatic cases, which jolts and traumatizes the public.
Additionally, the PIL sought directions for schools to introduce gender sensitivity classes, along with sex education and regular workshops by qualified child psychologists. These would aim to educate boys and girls on biological changes during adolescence and how to handle them in a healthy way.
The plea also stressed the need for government efforts to develop and implement nationwide adolescent programs, in light of the increasing number of adolescent-related issues, including the lack of knowledge on gender equity, sexual harassment, abuse, legal age for marriage, and juvenile delinquency.

Title: PM Modi to launch infrastructure projects worth over ₹46,300 crore in Rajasthan
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 13:36:28 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Rajasthan on December 17 to participate in the ‘Ek Varsh-Parinaam Utkarsh’ program, commemorating one year of the State Government of Rajasthan. During the event in Jaipur, PM Modi will inaugurate and lay the foundation stone for 24 infrastructure projects valued at over ₹46,300 crores. These projects span various sectors, including energy, road, railways, and water.
The projects include nine inaugurations and 15 foundation stone ceremonies. Of these, seven central government projects and two state government projects will be inaugurated, while nine central government projects and six state government projects will see their foundation stones laid.
Among the inaugurations is the Navnera Barrage, which aims to augment the state’s water resources, and a Smart Electricity Transmission Network with an Asset Management System. Railway electrification works for the Bhildi-Samdari-Luni-Jodhpur-Merta Road-Degana-Ratangarh section will also be inaugurated. A major bridge over the Mej River, part of the Delhi-Vadodara Green Field Alignment (NH-148N) project, will also be launched.
The foundation will be laid for additional water and energy infrastructure, including the construction of the Ramgarh Barrage and Mahalpur Barrage. Systems will also be initiated for transferring water from the Navnera Barrage to Bisalpur Dam and Isarda Dam through an aqueduct over the Chambal River. These projects are projected to cost over ₹9,400 crore.
PM Modi will also lay the foundation for solar energy projects, such as the installation of rooftop solar systems on government office buildings and the development of a 2000 MW solar park in Poogal, Bikaner. Two additional 1000 MW phases of solar parks will also commence under the project.
In the water sector, the visit includes the launch of a drinking water transmission line connecting Saipau (Dholpur) with Bharatpur-Deeg-Kumher-Nagar-Kaman & Pahari, as well as Chambal-Dholpur-Bharatpur retrofitting works.

Title: Centre receives Rs 8,625 crore as disinvestment receipts so far in 2024-25
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 12:49:47 +0000
Content: The government has received Rs 8,625 crore through disinvestment receipts during the financial year 2024-25, with these funds raised through various minority stake sale transactions, MoS Finance Pankaj Chaudhary informed in a written reply to the Lok Sabha.
In response to a query on disinvestment targets over the last five years, the minister said that the government stopped setting specific disinvestment targets beginning in the 2023-24 financial year. For 2024-25, no disinvestment estimate or target has been set.
“So far, the Government has received Rs. 8,625 crore through various minority stake sale disinvestment transactions during the current financial year,” the minister said.
The government typically conducts disinvestment through minority stake sales and strategic disinvestments of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs).
Strategic disinvestment involves the full or substantial sale of government shareholding in a CPSE along with the transfer of management control. In the case of privatization, the government’s equity and management control in a CPSE are transferred to a private buyer, while in other instances, equity is transferred to another CPSE along with control.
“The policy on strategic disinvestment/privatization is based on the economic principle that Government should discontinue in sectors, where competitive markets have come of age and economic potential of such entities may be better discovered in the hands of strategic investor due to various factors such as infusion of capital, technological upgradation and efficient management practices,” the minister added.
Profitability or loss is, however, not among the relevant criteria for privatization or strategic disinvestment.
Disinvestment is an ongoing process, and execution/completion of specific transactions hinges upon market conditions, domestic and global economic outlook, geopolitical factors, investor interest and administrative feasibility.
The government, since 2016, has given ‘in-principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment of 36 cases of PSEs and/or Subsidiaries/Units/Joint Ventures of PSEs/Bank.

Title: Japan, India startups to study laser-equipped satellite to tackle space debris
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 07:31:13 +0000
Content: Space startups in Japan and India said on Tuesday they had agreed to jointly study using laser-equipped satellites to remove debris from orbit, an experimental approach to the increasingly imminent problem of orbital congestion.
Tokyo-based Orbital Lasers and Indian robotics company InspeCity said they would study business opportunities for in-space services such as de-orbiting a defunct satellite and extending a spacecraft’s life.
Carved out from Japanese satellite giant SKY Perfect JSAT this year, Orbital Lasers is building a system that will use laser energy to stop the rotation of space junk by vaporising small parts of its surface, making it easier for a servicing spacecraft to rendezvous.
Orbital Lasers plans to demonstrate the system in space and supply it to operators after 2027, said Aditya Baraskar, the company’s global business lead. It can be mounted on InspeCity satellites if the companies clear regulatory requirements in India and Japan, Baraskar added.
The companies said they had signed a preliminary agreement to initiate the collaboration. InspeCity was founded in 2022 and raised $1.5 million last year, while Orbital Lasers has raised 900 million yen ($5.8 million) since it was established in January.
A United Nations panel on space traffic coordination in late October said that urgent action was necessary to track and manage objects in low Earth orbit because of the rapid increase in satellites and space junk.
There are already more than 100 companies in the space servicing market as satellite constellations expand, Nobu Okada, chief executive of Japanese debris mitigation pioneer Astroscale, said earlier this year.
The project is the latest example of collaboration between Japan and India, whose governments are working together on the joint Lunar Polar Exploration (LUPEX) mission, which could launch as early as 2026.
Indian rocket maker Skyroot and satellite builder HEX20 are also working with Japanese moon exploration firm ispace on a future lunar orbiter mission.
The two countries’ commercial space tie-ups have been driven by Japanese satellite data solutions for India’s disaster management and agriculture, and can expand to more fields such as manufacturing, said Masayasu Ishida, chief executive of Tokyo-based nonprofit SPACETIDE, which has hosted space business conferences since 2015.
“The key is finding where and how to build complementary relationships” that align with national policies such as Make in India, which aims to boost local production, Ishida said.

Title: Amit Shah oversees signing of key agreements to boost Chhattisgarh’s forest produce and dairy sectors
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 06:46:34 +0000
Content: Amit Shah oversees signing of key agreements to boost Chhattisgarh’s forest produce and dairy sectors
In a bid to boost Chhattisgarh’s minor forest produce and dairy sectors, two significant agreements were signed in Raipur on Monday in the presence of Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation, Amit Shah.
These initiatives are in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘Sahkar Se Samriddhi’ (prosperity through cooperation) and aim to strengthen the cooperative movement in the state.
The first agreement, between the Chhattisgarh State Minor Forest Produce (Trading and Development) Cooperative Federation Limited (CGMFPFED) and the National Cooperative Organics Limited (NCOL), will provide better market access for certified forest produce, benefiting thousands of tribal farmers.
Speaking at the event, Shah underscored the role of cooperation in fostering prosperity for tribal communities and reducing the influence of Naxalism.
A second agreement was signed between the Chhattisgarh Government, the Chhattisgarh State Cooperative Dairy Federation, and the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) to revamp the state’s dairy sector.
This partnership will expand dairy cooperatives to every village, significantly increasing milk production. Shah highlighted how this initiative will empower women from marginalized communities and improve rural livelihoods.
The agreements support the Modi government’s emphasis on organic farming, offering certified organic products such as wild honey, cashew, and turmeric under the ‘Bharat Organics’ brand.
The initiatives aim to enhance farmers’ income, promote ecological sustainability, and bring organic products to both national and international markets.
Shah assured the Ministry of Cooperation’s full support in advancing these efforts, emphasizing that cooperation is key to driving both prosperity and peace in the region.

Title: Canada finance minister quits after clash with Trudeau over Trump tariffs, spending
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 06:38:48 +0000
Content: Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland quit on Monday after clashing with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on issues including how to handle possible U.S. tariffs, dealing an unexpected blow to an already unpopular government.
Freeland said she was quitting in the wake of a meeting last Friday with Trudeau, who asked her to take on a lesser post after the two had been arguing for weeks over spending.
Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc – a member of Trudeau’s inner circle – was quickly named finance minister of the minority Liberal government.
The resignation of Freeland, 56, who also served as deputy prime minister, is one of the biggest crises Trudeau has faced since taking power in November 2015. It also leaves him without a key ally when he is on track to lose the next election to the official opposition Conservatives.
A Liberal source said Trudeau wanted Freeland to serve as minister without portfolio dealing with Canada-U.S. relations in name only – in effect a major demotion.
Trudeau met the national Liberal caucus later on Monday – including Freeland – but legislators declined to say afterwards what had happened.
Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon said there had been a good and frank conversation but gave no details.
Trudeau later told a Liberal Party fundraiser in Ottawa that being prime minister was the privilege of his life.
“It’s obviously been an eventful day. It has not been an easy day,” he said.
The potential threat to his future was underlined when a top member of the opposition New Democrats, who have been helping keep the Liberals in power, said the party would vote to bring down Trudeau next year unless he quit.
“If we’re coming up to a straight up non-confidence motion at the end of February, early March, that’s one of the tools that we have,” House of Commons leader for the NDP Peter Julian told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
“We simply cannot continue like this,” he said, adding he expected Trudeau to have resigned by then.
Party leader Jagmeet Singh had earlier been less equivocal when asked about bringing down Trudeau, whom he insisted should resign.
Freeland quit just hours before she was due to present a fall economic update to parliament. The document showed the minority Liberal government had run up a 2023/24 budget deficit of C$61.9 billion, much higher than predicted.
Trudeau can be toppled if the opposition parties unite against him on a vote of no confidence, though that cannot happen until next year.
“Will the Prime Minister stay on? I think he will, but he’s certainly been seriously threatened … it could be that this is the event that will push him over the edge,” said Jonathan Malloy, a political science professor at Carleton University in Ottawa.
Parliament is due to break for Christmas on Tuesday and not return until Jan. 27.
Domestic media reports said Freeland and Trudeau had clashed over a government proposal for temporary tax breaks and other spending measures.
“For the last number of weeks, you and I have found ourselves at odds over the best path forward for Canada,” Freeland said in a letter to Trudeau posted on X.
Freeland said the threat of new U.S. tariffs represented a grave threat.
“That means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a tariff war. That means eschewing costly political gimmicks, which we can ill afford,” she wrote.
Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said the government was spiraling out of control.
“We cannot accept this kind of chaos, division, weakness, while we’re staring down the barrel of a 25% tariff from our biggest trading partner,” he told reporters.
‘LEADERSHIP CRISIS’
“This will likely trigger a leadership crisis within the Liberal caucus … (it) is politically and personally devastating for Trudeau,” said Nik Nanos, founder of the Nanos Research polling firm.
Polls show the Liberals are set to be crushed in an election that must be held by late October 2025.
Freeland served as trade minister and then foreign minister before taking over the finance portfolio in August 2020. As minister, she oversaw the massive government spending campaign to deal with the damage done by COVID.
Trudeau has been under pressure for months from Liberal legislators alarmed by the party’s poor polling numbers, in part due to unhappiness over high prices, and the loss of two safe parliamentary seats in special elections.
The party is due to contest another special election in the province of British Columbia later on Monday.
‘BOMBSHELL’ DECISION
“This is quite a bombshell,” said Nelson Wiseman, political science professor at University of Toronto. “I think the problem the Liberals have is that they have no mechanism to remove Trudeau. Only a full blown caucus revolt could do that.”
Canada’s 10-year note yields CA10YT=RR climbed to their highest level since Nov. 28. They were last up 4.2 basis points at 3.2%. The Canadian dollarCAD= weakened to a four and a half year low at 1.4268 per U.S. dollar before reversing course.
When Trump came to power in 2017 he vowed to tear up the trilateral free trade treaty with Canada and Mexico. Freeland played a large role in helping renegotiate the pact and saving Canada’s economy, which is heavily reliant on the United States.
Although tensions between prime ministers and finance ministers are not unusual – Trudeau’s first finance minister quit in 2020 in a clash over spending – the level of invective in Freeland’s letter was remarkable by Canadian standards.
Freeland left the same day as Housing Minister Sean Fraser announced he was resigning for family reasons. Another six ministers have either already quit or announced they will not be running again in the next election.
Before entering politics in 2013, Freeland worked as a journalist and in senior editorial roles with several media companies, including the Financial Times, the Globe and Mail, and Reuters where she worked from 2010 to 2013.

Title: What is the significance of the Golan Heights?
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 06:28:26 +0000
Content: The Israeli government decided on Sunday to double its population on the occupied Golan Heights while saying threats from Syria remained despite the moderate tone of rebel leaders who ousted President Bashar al-Assad.
Israel captured most of the strategic plateau from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War and annexed it in 1981.
After Assad fled Syria on Dec. 8, Israeli troops moved into a demilitarised zone inside Syria, including the Syrian side of strategic Mount Hermon, which overlooks Damascus, where its forces took over an abandoned Syrian military post.
Israel called the incursion a temporary measure to ensure border security.
Following is a quick guide to the hilly, 1,200-square-kilometre (460 square-mile) Golan Heights, a fertile and strategic plateau that overlooks Israel’s Galilee region as well as Lebanon, and borders Jordan.
WHY IS THE AREA CONTENTIOUS?
In 2019 then-President Donald Trump declared U.S. support for Israeli sovereignty over the Golan, but the annexation has not been recognised by most countries. Syria demands Israel withdraw but Israel refuses, citing security concerns.
Syria tried to regain the Golan in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, but was thwarted. Israel and Syria signed an armistice in 1974 and the Golan has been relatively quiet since.
In 2000 Israel and Syria held their highest-level talks over a possible return of the Golan and a peace agreement. But the negotiations collapsed and subsequent talks also failed.
Netanyahu said on Sunday that he spoke on Saturday with Trump, who returns to the White House on Jan. 20. The Israeli leader said his country had no interest in conflict with Syria.
WHY DOES ISRAEL WANT THE GOLAN?
Security. Israel said earlier in Syria’s more than decade-long civil war that it demonstrated the need to keep the plateau as a buffer zone between Israeli towns and the instability of its neighbour.
Israel’s government also voiced concern that Iran, a longtime ally of the Assad regime, was trying to cement its presence on Syria’s side of the border in order to launch attacks on Israel. Israel frequently bombed suspected Iranian military assets in Syria in the years before Assad’s fall.
Israel and Syria have both coveted the Golan’s water resources and naturally fertile soil.
WHO LIVES ON THE GOLAN?
Some 31,000 Israelis have settled there, said analyst Avraham Levine of the Alma Research and Education Center specialising in Israel’s security challenges on its northern border. Many work in farming, including vineyards, and tourism. The Golan is home to 24,000 Druze, an Arab minority who practice an offshoot of Islam, Levine said.
Many of the Druze adherents in Syria were long loyal to the Assad regime. Many families have members on both sides of the demarcation line. After annexing the Golan, Israel gave the Druze the option of citizenship, but most rejected it and still identify as Syrian.
WHO CONTROLS THE SYRIAN SIDE OF THE GOLAN?
Before the outbreak of Syria’s civil war in 2011, there was an uneasy stand-off between Israeli and Syrian forces.
But in 2014 anti-government Islamist rebels overran Quneitra province on the Syrian side. The rebels forced Assad’s forces to withdraw and also turned on U.N. forces in the area, forcing them to pull back from some of their positions.
The area remained under rebel control until the summer of 2018, when Assad’s forces returned to the largely ruined city of Quneitra and the surrounding area following a Russian-backed offensive and a deal that allowed rebels to withdraw.
WHAT SEPARATES THE TWO SIDES ON THE GOLAN?
A United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) is stationed in camps and observation posts along the Golan, supported by military observers of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO).
Between the Israeli and Syrian armies is a 400-square-km (155-square-mile) “Area of Separation” – often called a demilitarised zone – in which the two countries’ armed forces are not permitted under the ceasefire arrangement.
The Separation of Forces Agreement of May 31, 1974, created an Alpha Line to the west of the area of separation, behind which Israeli military forces must remain, and a Bravo Line to the east behind which Syrian military forces must remain.
Extending 25 km (15 miles) beyond the “Area of Separation” on both sides is an “Area of Limitation” in which there are restrictions on the number of troops and number and kinds of weapons that both sides can have there.
There is one crossing point between the Israeli and Syrian sides, which until the Syrian civil war began was used mainly by United Nations forces, a limited number of Druze civilians and for the transport of agricultural produce.
WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE ASSAD’S OUSTER?
Netanyahu’s government unanimously approved a more than 40-million-shekel ($11 million) plan on Sunday to encourage demographic growth in the Golan.
It said Netanyahu submitted the plan to the government “in light of the war and the new front facing Syria, and out of a desire to double the population of the Golan”.
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates condemned Israel’s decision, with the UAE – which normalised relations with Israel in 2020 – describing it as a “deliberate effort to expand the occupation”.
Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on Syria’s strategic weapons stockpiles and military infrastructure, it says, to prevent them from being used by rebel groups that drove Assad from power, some of which grew from movements linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State.
Syria’s de facto leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, said on Saturday that Israel was using false pretexts to justify its attacks on Syria, but he was not interested in engaging in new conflicts as his country focuses on rebuilding.
Sharaa – better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani – leads the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that ousted Assad on Dec. 8, ending the family’s five-decade iron-fisted rule.
He said diplomatic solutions were the only way to ensure security and stability and that “uncalculated military adventures” were not wanted.
Israel Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement on Sunday that the latest developments in Syria increased the threat to Israel, “despite the moderate image that the rebel leaders claim to present”.

Title: North-East gateway to vast Southeast Asian markets, Scindia tells investors
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 05:28:03 +0000
Content: The North-East serves as India’s gateway to the South and investing in the region will give investors access to the vast Southeast Asian markets, Union Minister for Communications and Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), Jyotiraditya Scindia, said on Monday.
Speaking at the ‘North East Trade and Investment Roadshow’ in Mumbai, the minister emphasised the region’s immense potential, which now stands ready to contribute to India’s growth with an impressive 11 per cent GDP growth rate.
“The development of infrastructure, human resources, and specialised sectors has positioned North-East India as a key player in the nation’s future,” he said.
Scindia emphasised the importance of building bridges between the vibrant business ecosystems of Mumbai and North-East, thereby ensuring a seamless path for growth and innovation.
The minister further outlined the region’s progress in various sectors, including tourism, renewable energy, sports and IT, and emphasised the need for a focused quality-driven approach for development of the region.
He assured investors that the region’s youth, high literacy rates, and abundant natural resources make it an ideal destination for investment, particularly in areas like sustainable agriculture, manufacturing, and technology.
“With policies in place to support business growth and a commitment to reducing red tape, North-East India is now offering a red carpet to investors, which will contribute to the growth of India, especially its youth,” said Scindia.
Tripura Chief Minister Professor (Dr) Manik Saha reaffirmed that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the North-East region, particularly Tripura, is witnessing remarkable growth.
Tripura, recognised as one of the most peaceful states, has demonstrated impressive economic performance with a per capita income of Rs 1,77,000, making it the second-largest GSDP contributor in North-East.
With robust infrastructure, including excellent road, water, air, and rail connectivity, and a supportive investment climate, the state is becoming a preferred destination for investors.
Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma said the state is witnessing transformative growth, driven by strong leadership with a focused investment and development strategy.

Title: Sensex, Nifty decline as trade deficit, weak exports weigh on investor sentiment
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 05:26:50 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets opened lower on Tuesday as weak export data and a record-high trade deficit in November dampened investor sentiment.
The Nifty slipped 0.3% to 24,599 points as of 09:20 a.m, while the Sensex fell 0.3% to 81,492.02.
Market experts cited the widening trade deficit as the key factor affecting sentiment. Ajay Bagga, a banking and market expert, emphasized the implications of November’s trade deficit, which surged to a record $37.8 billion from $27.1 billion in October. “The economic data underscores the need for intervention by the RBI. A rate cut is increasingly likely as the rising trade deficit poses risks of further rupee depreciation,” Bagga said.
Bagga criticized the RBI’s recent approach, adding, “The central bank has used over $50 billion in FX reserves to support the rupee, which has been counterproductive. A depreciation of the rupee could have boosted export competitiveness while curbing imports.” He further called for monetary easing and liquidity injections to address the economic challenges.
In sectoral performance, selling pressure dominated, with Nifty Bank, Nifty Auto, and Nifty IT indices opening in the red, while Nifty FMCG, Nifty Media, and Nifty Pharma recorded gains.
Among Nifty 50 stocks, 16 gained while 34 declined in early trading. Cipla, Tata Motors, Tech Mahindra, Adani Ports, and BEL emerged as top gainers, while Shriram Finance, Grasim, Reliance, Eicher Motors, and Britannia led the losers’ list.
Akshay Chinchalkar, Head of Research at Axis Securities, provided a technical outlook, said, “For today, resistance is seen between 24,726 and 24,800, with support in the 24,554–24,580 range. Notably, Friday’s low held at the Bollinger-middle line, suggesting active buyer interest despite reduced volumes and higher volatility expected in the coming sessions.”
In Asian markets, a mixed trend was observed. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.15%, and Taiwan Weighted gained 0.34%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, South Korea’s KOSPI, and Jakarta Composite registered declines of 0.39%.

Title: Trump says deal needed to stop Ukraine war, will talk to Putin and Zelenskiy
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 05:20:17 +0000
Content: President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy should be prepared to make a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin to bring an end to the nearly three-year-old Ukraine war.
“Gotta make a deal,” Trump said at a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.
Trump said he would talk to Putin and Zelenskiy about bringing the war in Ukraine to an end, saying he is troubled by images of carnage from the conflict.
“It’s got to stop,” Trump said.
Trump did not give a direct answer when asked whether he believed Ukraine should cede territory to Russia as part of a negotiated settlement to end the war.
Trump said much of the territory in dispute has been reduced to rubble and that it would take a century to recover.
“I mean, there are cities that there’s not a building standing, it’s a demolition site,” he said.
He also said he had been shown pictures of body-strewn battlefields that reminded him of some of the grisly photographs from the 1861-1865 American Civil War.
Trump has said he would like to bring a quick end to the war but has been cagey on the details. He told Time magazine in an interview published last week that he had a “very good plan” to help but that if he reveals it now “it becomes almost a worthless plan.”

Title: Centre to introduce ‘One Nation, One Election’ Bill in Lok Sabha today
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 05:15:14 +0000
Content: The Centre is set to introduce the ‘One Nation, One Election’ (ONOP) Bill in the Lok Sabha today at noon, marking a significant step towards the proposal to hold simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and state assemblies across India.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has issued a three-line whip to all its MPs, urging them to be present in the House during the introduction of the bill. The agenda for today’s Lok Sabha session includes the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, which will pave the way for simultaneous elections.
Union Law Minister Arjun Meghwal is expected to introduce the bill, which aims to bring about synchronized elections across the country. Along with the One Nation, One Election Bill, Meghwal is also likely to present legislation aimed at aligning elections in Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, and Puducherry with the nationwide simultaneous elections.
The Union Cabinet had approved the bill earlier this month, following the recommendations of the High-Level Committee on Simultaneous Elections chaired by former President Ram Nath Kovind. The committee proposed the implementation of simultaneous elections in two phases: first, holding Lok Sabha and state assembly elections together, and later, conducting local body elections (panchayats and municipalities) within 100 days of the general elections. A common electoral roll for all elections was also recommended.
After the bill’s introduction, Arjun Meghwal is expected to seek approval from the Lok Sabha Speaker to refer the bill to a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) for wider consultations. The JPC will be constituted on a pro-rata basis, depending on the strength of MPs from various parties.
While the BJP and its allies in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) have expressed support for the bill, several opposition parties, including Congress, Trinamool Congress, and DMK, have voiced strong opposition. Congress leader Digvijaya Singh raised concerns over the practicality of the bill, questioning what would happen if a state government falls before the scheduled elections. He argued that it would be unjust for a state to remain without a government for the rest of the term.
Jairam Ramesh, Congress MP, also demanded that the bill be referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee for further discussions, stating that it undermines democratic principles. He pointed out that Congress had clearly opposed the proposal, as expressed in a letter by party president Mallikarjun Kharge to the Kovind committee last year.
Despite opposition concerns, the bill has been welcomed by the BJP-led NDA alliance, which claims that One Nation, One Election will save time, reduce election costs, and streamline the electoral process across the country.

Title: Rain pauses third Australia-India test after lunch; Smith redeems dropped catch to deny Rahul’s century at Gabba
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 04:55:05 +0000
Content: Rain delayed the resumption of play after lunch on day four of the third test between Australia and India in Brisbane on Tuesday.
India were 167 for six in reply to Australia’s first innings 445 at the Gabba, still needing 79 runs to avoid the follow-on.
Ravindra Jadeja was 41 not out at the break, with fellow all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy on seven.
Earlier, Steve Smith redeemed himself with a stunning catch to deny KL Rahul a rousing century and give Australia a vital breakthrough before lunch on day four of the third test in Brisbane on Tuesday.
Fielding at slip, Smith leapt to his right to pluck a one-hander after spinner Nathan Lyon induced an edge from opener Rahul, who fell for 84 as India went to lunch at 167 for six, still 79 runs from avoiding the follow-on.
The catch broke a stubborn 67-run partnership with recalled all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja which had given India hope of staving off a second successive defeat in the five-match series.
It was also a relief for Smith after he dropped a waist-high chance in the slips on the first ball of the morning by captain Pat Cummins to reprieve Rahul on 33.
Jadeja was 41 not out at the break, with fellow all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy on seven.
Though Australia have dominated the rain-hit test, time may deny the hosts from taking a 2-1 lead in the series after rain wiped out most of days one and three.
Australia’s task was made tougher by a calf problem for paceman Josh Hazlewood, who bowled only one over in the morning before a team spokesperson said he would be taken for scans.
Whichever way the match goes; the India captain Rohit Sharma will face more scrutiny after another failure with the bat.
He was caught behind for 10 nicking fast bowler Cummins with a lead-footed drive one ball after being softened up by a bouncer from the Australian skipper.
Rohit has 19 runs from his three innings in the series, having missed India’s victory in Perth while caring for his new-born son.
India, who resumed on 51 for four in the morning on Tuesday, trail Australia’s first innings 445 by 278 runs.
The series is level at 1-1.

Title: Combined liver, kidney transplant successfully done on 54-year-old man in Hyderabad
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 13:14:20 +0000
Content: Star Hospitals has successfully performed a simultaneous liver and kidney transplant on a 54-year-old critically ill patient, Rama Rao, a businessman from Ongole, Andhra Pradesh.  
 
The patient suffered from liver and kidney failure, compounded by multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, and hepatitis B infection. Diagnosed with liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, his condition worsened over time, leading to water retention in the body (ascites) and kidney failure, further complicating his health.  
 
Admitted to Star Hospitals’ Hepatology and Liver Transplant department, he presented with severe infection, low blood pressure, hepatic coma, and toxin accumulation in the blood due to combined liver and kidney failure. With less than a 10% chance of survival in such cases, stabilising the patient in the ICU and performing an urgent simultaneous liver and kidney transplant was critical.  
 
This extraordinary feat was made possible by the patient’s family, who demonstrated remarkable selflessness. The patient’s spouse donated a kidney, while his son donated a portion of his liver.  
 
The complex 12-hour surgery involved simultaneous operations on both donors and the patient in adjacent operating theatres. Both donors were discharged within a week in excellent condition, while the patient experienced a smooth recovery, marking a new lease on life.  
 
Dr. Mettu Srinivas Reddy, Director and Lead Surgeon at Star Liver Institute, highlighted the case’s complexity: “Multi-organ transplantation is a highly challenging procedure, especially for critically ill patients. Successfully conducting such a surgery using two family donors demands exceptional technical expertise and coordination. Our interdisciplinary team of over 50 specialists worked seamlessly to ensure success.”  
 
Dr. Golamari Srinivasa Reddy, Clinical Lead Consultant for Hepatology and Transplant Hepatology, explained the challenges in managing the patient: “Severe liver cirrhosis and kidney failure, especially when complicated by infection, can be fatal without immediate treatment. This case underlines the importance of specialised liver intensive care and screening for hepatitis B to prevent such conditions.”  
 
Dr. Sridhar, Director of Nephrology and Renal Transplant, emphasised the need for a kidney transplant: “With the patient’s kidney function severely impaired, a kidney transplant was vital. Without it, he would have required frequent dialysis, even post-liver transplant. A simultaneous procedure was crucial for sustainable recovery.”  
 
Dr. Ravindranath, Chief Mentor at Star Liver Institute, lauded the hospital’s capabilities: “This successful multi-organ transplant showcases the unmatched expertise of our medical team and our advanced facilities, making Star Hospitals a preferred destination for complex healthcare needs.

Title: Over 57,000 sewer and septic tank workers identified under NAMASTE scheme
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 12:18:06 +0000
Content: The National Action for Mechanised Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) scheme has profiled over 57,758 Sewer and Septic Tank Workers (SSWs) across India, with 54,574 workers validated so far, Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment, Ramdas Athawale, informed the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.
The initiative, launched in the 2023-24 fiscal year, seeks to ensure safety, dignity, and socio-economic empowerment for sanitation workers. It is being implemented across more than 4,800 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) under a collaboration between the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJ&E) and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).
The data reveals that sanitation work remains deeply entrenched in social inequalities, with 67.91% of the workers coming from Scheduled Castes (SC), followed by 15.73% from Other Backward Classes (OBC), 8.31% from Scheduled Tribes (ST), and 8.05% from the General category.
Over 16,791 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits and 43 safety devices kits for Emergency Response Sanitation Units (ERSUs) have been distributed to improve worker safety. Health benefits have been extended to 13,604 workers and their families through Ayushman cards. A capital subsidy of Rs. 13.96 crore has been granted to 503 sanitation workers and dependents for sanitation-related projects. Additionally, Rs. 2.85 crore has been disbursed to 226 workers for alternative self-employment opportunities. 837 workshops have been conducted across municipalities to raise awareness of safe sanitation practices and to train workers on preventing hazardous cleaning methods.
To eradicate unsafe manual cleaning practices, the government has focused on mechanization. Under the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 (SBM-U 2.0), Rs. 371 crore has been allocated to 26 states and Union Territories for procuring 2,585 desludging vehicles. This mechanization is expected to reduce health hazards and improve efficiency in sanitation work.
Furthermore, guidelines have been issued by MoHUA to all states and UTs, emphasizing strict safety procedures, the establishment of ERSUs, and the use of modern equipment for sewer and septic tank cleaning.
The integration of data from states like Tamil Nadu and Odisha into the central NAMASTE database is currently underway to ensure a more comprehensive outreach. The government is actively working to expand the scheme’s benefits to all sanitation workers nationwide.

Title: Western governments expand contacts with Syria’s new leadership
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 12:10:20 +0000
Content: German and French officials are due to meet representatives of Syria’s new governing authorities in Damascus on Tuesday, expanding Western contacts with the new administration after British diplomats met its leader Ahmed al-Sharaa late on Monday.
Nine days after Bashar al-Assad was ousted, the new prime minister installed by Sharaa’s Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group said the government was grappling with very low currency reserves and called for sanctions to be lifted.
Western states are gradually opening channels to the new authorities in Damascus led by HTS, though they continue to designate it as a terrorist group.
Late on Monday, Sharaa, formerly known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, met a British foreign ministry delegation. He stressed the need for the restoration of ties and lifting sanctions on Syria so that Syrian refugees can return home, the Syrian state news agency SANA reported.
Photos published by SANA showed Sharaa, whose group was part of al Qaeda until he broke ties in 2016, sitting in a suit with an open shirt during the meeting, his highest level encounter yet with a Western government official since HTS seized power.
The images underline the geopolitical shift since Assad was toppled by HTS-led forces, a blow to Assad’s Russian and Iranian allies which could potentially open the way for Western states to reopen contacts with Damascus.
But for now at least, any Western overtures require manoeuvring around both the terrorism designation imposed on HTS during its days as an al Qaeda affiliate and financial sanctions imposed on Damascus under Assad.
Sharaa “spoke about the need to build a state of law and institutions, and establishing security,” SANA reported. “He also spoke about Britain’s important role internationally.”
Ahead of the meeting, British foreign minister David Lammy said London had sent a delegation of senior officials to Damascus to meet with the new interim Syrian authorities and civil society groups.
German diplomats are also planning talks with representatives of HTS in Damascus on Tuesday, the German foreign ministry said.
A German foreign ministry spokesperson said the talks would focus on a transitional process for Syria and the protection of minorities.
“The possibilities of a diplomatic presence in Damascus are also being explored there,” the spokesperson added in a statement, reiterating that Berlin was monitoring HTS closely in light of its roots in al Qaeda ideology.
“As far as one can tell, they have acted prudently so far,” the spokesperson said.
The new administration in Damascus has set out few details on its thinking for the next steps, even as it has swiftly established control over state institutions.
The justice of Islam
In an interview with Al Jazeera Mubasher, the newly installed Prime Minister Mohammed al-Bashir said the defence ministry would be restructured using using former rebel factions and officers who defected from Assad’s army.
Asked what he would say to those worried about a single religious or political group dominating Syria, Bashir said: “Those who are afraid…of a religion trend or anything else doesn’t truly understand Islam, the forgiveness of Islam, the justice of Islam”.
“Syria is for all Syrians,” he said. “Everyone is a partner for us building the Syria of the future.”
Bashir, who formerly led an HTS-affiliated government in Idlib province, has said he will remain in office until March.
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on Monday the European Union should be ready to ease sanctions on Syria if the country’s new leadership takes “positive steps” to establish an inclusive government and respect women’s and minority rights.
The Syrian conflict, which spiralled out of 2011 uprising against Assad’s repressive rule, drove millions of Syrians abroad as refugees, including around 1 million who went to Germany.
French diplomats are also expected to visit Damascus later on Tuesday to meet HTS representatives, French officials said.
The U.S. State Department said on Monday that the U.S. government has had more than one communication with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) over the past week.

Title: South Korean authorities fail to raid presidential office again, Yonhap says
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:56:30 +0000
Content: South Korean investigators probing President Yoon Suk Yeol’s short-lived martial law declaration failed to gain entry to his office to seek evidence on Tuesday after presidential office security staff denied them entry, Yonhap news agency reported.
Yoon was impeached on Saturday over his martial law decree and suspended from his presidential duties. Yonhap said that investigators looking for evidence about the legality of Yoon’s martial law decision waited for about seven hours to be let in, but the presidential office security service denied them entry.
A joint investigation team including police and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) was trying to access computer servers of the presidential office’s security service to get records of phones including one used by the police commissioner, Yonhap said, citing the team.
This would be the second time authorities have tried and failed to raid the presidential office over the declaration of martial law that was reversed within hours after a standoff with parliament.
An attempt on Dec. 11 ended without entry, but the presidential office voluntarily submitted some data.
The presidential office’s security service said it would express its position on Wednesday concerning cooperation with raids, Yonhap reported.
The police and the presidential office did not have an immediate comment on Tuesday. The CIO declined to comment.
Since his last public remarks shortly after he was impeached by parliament in a vote on Saturday, Yoon has kept a low profile and authorities and the Constitutional Court have not been able to contact or summon him, according to the court and officials.
Yoon has been putting together legal teams to defend himself against accusations of insurrection and in the Constitutional Court case which will decide whether to remove him from office or restore his powers.
Seok Dong-Hyun, a lawyer and an ex-prosecutor who helps Yoon, told reporters on Tuesday that the president’s declaration of martial law did not constitute insurrection, Yonhap reported.
Yoon would also “confidently express his position in the (Constitutional) Court”, Yonhap cited Seok as saying.
Seok declined to say whether Yoon would comply with a summons to appear for questioning on Dec. 21, and said authorities needed to streamline current investigations being conducted by several agencies at once, including the prosecution, the police and the CIO, Yonhap reported.
Seok could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters.
Meanwhile, South Korea’s acting president Han Duck-soo on Tuesday called during a cabinet meeting for next year’s government budget to be swiftly implemented from the start of 2025 in order to help revive the country’s slowing economy.
Han has been working to reassure South Korea’s allies and calm financial markets since taking over the duties of Yoon after the president was impeached.
The government has decided to frontload 75% of its 2025 budget to be implemented during the first half of the year, the finance ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
South Korea faces economic challenges, including heightened uncertainty for the trade-dependent country created by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to hike tariffs, as export growth in Asia’s fourth-largest economy slowed for a fourth-straight month in November, to the weakest level in 14 months.
The foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday it launched a task force to respond to the new Trump administration’s foreign policies.

Title: Mayotte authorities fear hunger, disease after cyclone; death toll rises in Mozambique
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:36:00 +0000
Content: Authorities in Mayotte were racing on Tuesday to stop hunger, disease and lawlessness from spreading in the French overseas territory after the weekend’s devastating cyclone, while Mozambique reported dozens of deaths from the storm.
Hundreds or even thousands could be dead in Mayotte, which took the strongest hit from Cyclone Chido, French officials have said. The storm laid waste to large parts of the archipelago off east Africa, France’s poorest overseas territory, before striking continental Africa.
With many parts of Mayotte still inaccessible and some victims buried before their deaths could be officially counted, it may take days to discover the full extent of the destruction.
So far, 22 deaths and more than 1,400 injuries have been confirmed, Ambdilwahedou Soumaila, the mayor of the capital Mamoudzou, told Radio France Internationale on Tuesday morning.
“The priority today is water and food,” Soumaila said. “There are people who have unfortunately died where the bodies are starting to decompose that can create a sanitary problem.”
“We don’t have electricity. When night falls, there are people who take advantage of that situation.”
Twenty tonnes of food and water are due to start arriving on Tuesday by air and sea. The French government said late on Monday it expects 50% of water supplies to be restored within 48 hours and 95% within the week.
France’s interior ministry announced that a curfew would go into effect on Tuesday night from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. local time.
Rescue workers have been searching for survivors amid the debris of shantytowns bowled over by 200 kph (124 mph) winds.
Chido was the strongest storm to strike Mayotte in more than 90 years, French weather service Meteo France said. In Mozambique, it killed at least 34 people, officials said on Tuesday. Another seven died in Malawi.
Drone footage from Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado province, already experiencing a humanitarian crisis due to an Islamist insurgency, showed razed thatched-roof houses near the beach and personal belongings scattered under the few palm trees still standing.
Illegal Immigration
French President Emmanuel Macron said after an emergency cabinet meeting on Monday that he would visit Mayotte in the coming days, as the disaster quickly fuelled a political back-and-forth about immigration, the environment and France’s treatment of its overseas territories.
Mayotte has been grappling with unrest in recent years, with many residents angry at illegal immigration and inflation.
More than three-quarters of its roughly 321,000 people live in relative poverty, and about one-third are estimated to be undocumented migrants, most from nearby Comoros and Madagascar.
The territory has become a stronghold for the far-right National Rally with 60% voting for Marine Le Pen in the 2022 presidential election runoff.
France’s acting Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, from the conservative Republicans party, told a news conference in Mayotte that the early warning system had worked “perfectly” but many of the undocumented had not come to designated shelters.
Other officials have said undocumented migrants may have been afraid to go to shelters for fear of being arrested.
The toll of the cyclone, Retailleau said in a later post on X, underscored the need to address “the migration question”.
“Mayotte is the symbol of the drift that (French) governments have allowed to take hold on this issue,” he said. “We will need to legislate so that in Mayotte, like everywhere else on the national territory, France retakes control of its immigration.”
Left-wing politicians, however, have pointed the finger at what they say is the government’s neglect of Mayotte and failure to prepare for natural disasters linked to climate change.
Socialist Party chairman Olivier Faure blasted Retailleau’s comments in an X post.
“He could have interrogated the role of climate change in producing more and more intense climate disasters. He could have rallied against the extreme poverty that makes people more vulnerable to cyclones,” said Faure.
“No, he has resumed his crusade against migrants.”
Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, appointed last week to steer France out of a political crisis, faced criticism after he went to the town of Pau, where he is the mayor, to attend a municipal council meeting on Monday, instead of visiting Mayotte.

Title: Israeli airstrikes kill 14 Palestinians in Gaza, tanks push south
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:16:07 +0000
Content: Israeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip killed at least 14 Palestinians on Tuesday, at least 10 of them in one house in Gaza City, medics said as tanks pushed deeper towards the western area of Rafah in the south.
Medics said the Israeli airstrike on the house in the Daraj suburb of Gaza City destroyed the building and damaged nearby houses. Four other people were killed in two separate airstrikes in the city and the town of Beit Lahiya north of the enclave said medics, medics added.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.
In Rafah, near the border with Egypt, Israeli tanks pushed deeper towards the western area of Mawasi, known as a humanitarian-designated area, residents said.
Heavy fire from tanks rolling into the area forced dozens of families sheltering there to flee northwards towards Khan Younis.
The war began when the Palestinian militant group Hamas stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel then launched an air and land offensive that has killed more than 45,000 people, mostly civilians, according to authorities in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.
The campaign has displaced nearly the entire population and left much of the enclave in ruins.

Title: Market Jitters: Indian Shares Tumble Ahead of Global Rate Decisions
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:04:26 +0000
Content: Indian stocks closed sharply lower on Tuesday, dragged down by selling across major sectors including PSU banks, auto, IT, financial services, pharma, FMCG, metal, and realty. The decline comes as investors brace for crucial policy decisions from global central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, which is holding its last policy meeting of the year on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The Sensex ended the day at 80,684.4, down 1,064.12 points or 1.30%, while the Nifty fell 332.25 points, or 1.35%, to close at 24,336.
Market experts point to widespread pessimism ahead of policy announcements from the US Fed, Bank of Japan, and Bank of England. While a 25 basis point rate cut from the US Fed is largely expected, investors remain wary of any hawkish signals that could indicate further tightening.
The Nifty Bank also felt the pressure, closing at 52,834.80, down 746.55 points, or 1.39%. The Nifty Midcap 100 index and Nifty Smallcap 100 index dropped 0.57% and 0.68% respectively.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), 1,578 shares advanced while 2,440 declined. The media sector was the only one to show gains.
Among the Sensex constituents, major losers included Bharti Airtel, IndusInd Bank, JSW Steel, TCS, Asian Paints, L&T, Bajaj Finserv, Reliance, Nestle India, HDFC Bank, Maruti, M&M, Tata Steel, and Power Grid. ITC was the sole gainer amongst the top performers.
The Indian rupee remained relatively stable near 84.90 against the US dollar as markets await the Fed’s final policy decision of the year on December 18.
“A dovish tone from the Fed could weaken the dollar index, offering some relief to the rupee,” said Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst – Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities. “However, any uncertain or hawkish remarks may strengthen the dollar and maintain downward pressure on the rupee. We anticipate the rupee to trade between 84.75 and 85.05.”

Title: Punjab: Missing The Forest For The Trees
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:02:31 +0000
Content: A dispassionate conversation around Punjab is critically urgent, so much that it should have happened five years ago. For a while now, the discourse on Punjab has been lost to misplaced emotions, centered around the political agenda of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the ruling party in the state.
The recent assassination attempt on Sukhbir Singh Badal, the former Deputy Chief Minister and leader of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), is another testament to the growing troubles within the state. Law and order under the Bhagwant Mann government has been a subject of perpetual discussion and alarm. However, the state government and its representatives outside Punjab, including the former Chief Minister of Delhi, remain unperturbed.
Much to the dismay of the people of Punjab, disruption is the new forced reality. The law and order in the state is under threat from issues that lay dormant for over three decades, but are now crawling back to the mainstream. The Centre, not oblivious to the developments, has been leading a crackdown against the radical elements, wherever necessary, but the state government must play its role with far more responsibility.
There are several fundamental differences in the Punjab of 1984 and 2024. One, there is no resonance or audience for any movement against the state, not even remotely. Two, the Centre has a nationalist government at the helm with a far more mature understanding and realisation of the threats to Punjab. Three, the state is far more evolved, culturally and socially, and has discarded the baggage of the 1980s. However, the critical difference lies in the economic stature of Punjab, and that is where the focus must lie.
Punjab’s age of prosperity, driven by the Green Revolution, began in the 1960s. Even as violence engulfed the state across the 1980s, Punjab’s agricultural prosperity continued, along with Haryana.
Agriculture has been the bedrock of Punjab’s economy, but in the last few years, there has been a tectonic shift in the state, largely reliant on two crops, wheat and paddy, which cover close to 85 per cent of the cultivated area. This shift is both natural and inevitable, a virtue of the cycle of time, and one the state government is too stubborn to accept and prepare for.
Complement this stagnation in agriculture with the inability of the current and previous state government, under the Congress, to push forward manufacturing and services in the state, and the worries aggravate. The debt is projected to balloon to Rs. 3.74 lakh crore by the end of this fiscal year, amounting to more than 46 per cent of the state’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
In 2024-25, over Rs. 9,000 crore has already been allocated for power subsidy. The debt projected to be served this year exceeds Rs. 36,000 crore, including Rs. 24,000 crore (approximately), committed to interest payments. The problem is not merely the debt, but the state’s inability to raise revenues, as endless subsidies continue to plague the balance sheet.
The state government’s inability to raise the capital expenditure is no surprise. However, the Centre’s monetary efforts must not be squandered by the state government.
For instance, the protests for the acquisition of land for the Jamnagar-Amritsar highway, even when the land has already been acquired and the farmers have been paid, set a worrying precedent. Disrupting Centre’s capex spree in the state will only deter private sector investments in the long-run. The state desperately requires assets that can act as catalysts for revenue generation in the long-run, and it all begins with infrastructure.
Not development but protests have been making news when it comes to Punjab. Protests, redundant and without rationale, lost the sympathy and support of the general public in 2020-21, and yet, have continued, even if in scattered capacity, within the state and against the state government.
Along the stretch of the Grand Trunk Road in Punjab, running from Rajpura to Ambala, bordering Haryana, the protesters were prepared for another winter march to Delhi. The results on October 8 thwarted those plans, leaving the protesters squandering around the Shambhu border.
The stretch, indispensable to the economy of Punjab, remains blocked, as the national highway has become an illegal encroachment spot for parked tractors and temporary camps. Shambhu is perhaps the new Singhu, but much to the relief of the people of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi, Singhu is not going to witness an economic blockade again. The Centre has done its part in 2021 itself, and it is now up to the Bhagwan Mann government to solve this problem.
The futility of these protests does not get much attention in the mainstream media, unfortunately.
The futility of the protests must be called out. Congress, in Delhi, talks about legalising MSP (Minimum Support Price) but miserably fails when it comes to giving a fiscal feasibility plan. The Karnataka Congress government, in November 2024, rejected the paddy crop from Punjab, citing quality issues. Beyond the theatrical political activism, Congress in Delhi has no plan for Punjab and its economy.
Punjab’s economy will not be rescued by a legal MSP provision. The government, even if it decides to generously and mindlessly spend Rs. 10 lakh crore annually, the projected cost for legalising MSP, and an amount equal to our capex allocation, (the Centre’s expenditure for 2024-25 is budgeted at Rs. 48 lakh crore), the problems will still persist. Punjab’s budget borrows from its future, while its agriculture, endlessly, borrows from its ecology.
Contrary to popular misconception, the Centre has been aiding the farmers in Punjab monetarily. In the ongoing marketing season, over 7.7 lakh farmers have benefited, and in the earlier Rabi marketing season, over 21 lakh farmers were benefited with almost Rs. 60,000 crore paid for wheat procurement alone. The money will never run out, but the water is.
This is where the Narendra Modi government’s proposal to the farmers of Punjab was both economically sound and rooted in ecological realities. In order to create a financial security net for farmers to diversify away from water-intensive crops, the government offered to procure pulses, maizes, and cotton, at MSP, for five years, and with no upper limit of procurement. The farmers, however, buoyed by the state government, rejected the offer.
The window to make economic amends is narrowing. Punjab and its politics must ensure that they do not miss the forest for the trees. Too caught up in specifics, the current and past state government have been unwilling to read the room. The Aam Aadmi Party, both in Delhi and Punjab, in its exuberance, are writing political checks that the state’s economic capital cannot cash. At stake here is the state’s future.
Punjab must draw lessons from its past to not repeat history. The route to political instability goes through an economic crisis. A prospering economy leaves no room for the political vacuum to be taken over by anti-national elements.
What worked for Punjab for six decades is no longer working in the agricultural space. Taking a cue from Jammu where the lavender revolution is making headlines, Himachal Pradesh which has become a national player in horticulture, and Haryana that is embracing diversification and technology, the state must innovate.
Agriculture can have a domino effect on other sectors, creating opportunities in food processing and logistics, thus having a direct bearing on farm incomes and employment, and that can be the beginning of the rejuvenation of the state economy. Is there anyone within the state polity willing to play the long-game along with Delhi, remains the question.

Title: “Double engine govt becoming symbol of good governance,” says PM Modi at the ‘Ek Varsh-Parinaam Utkarsh’ programme
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 10:52:53 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday praised the Bhajanlal Sharma-led BJP government in Rajasthan, saying that the double-engine governance model has become a symbol of good governance. Addressing the ‘Ek Varsh-Parinaam Utkarsh’ programme in Jaipur, organized to celebrate one year of the BJP government in the state, PM Modi highlighted the increasing trust of the people in the BJP, referencing recent electoral victories in Maharashtra, Haryana, and the Lok Sabha elections.
“BJP’s double-engine government is the guarantee of good governance. The overwhelming support for the BJP in states and at the national level reflects the people’s faith in our policies. We have been given the opportunity to serve the nation in the Lok Sabha for a third consecutive term—a rare feat in the past 60 years. Recent victories in Maharashtra and Haryana further cement this trust,” said PM Modi.
He lauded Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma for bringing “new momentum and direction” to Rajasthan’s development and inaugurated infrastructure projects worth over ₹46,300 crore, aimed at resolving water issues, boosting connectivity, and creating employment opportunities in the state.
“Today marks not just one year of governance but a celebration of Rajasthan’s progress. These projects will make Rajasthan one of the most connected states in the country and provide solutions to its water challenges. They will also enhance investment opportunities, benefiting the youth, farmers, and tourism industry,” said PM Modi.
During the event, Prime Minister Modi inaugurated 9 projects worth over Rs 11,000 crore, including 7 central government projects and 2 state government initiatives, and laid the foundation stone for 15 projects worth over Rs 35,300 crore, comprising 9 central and 6 state projects.
The inaugurated projects include the Navnera Barrage, Smart Electricity Transmission Network and Asset Management System, Railway Electrification of the Bhildi-Samdari-Luni-Jodhpur-Merta Road-Degana-Ratangarh section, and Package 12 of the Delhi-Vadodara Green Field Alignment (NH-148N). These projects aim to enhance connectivity, energy efficiency, and sustainable infrastructure development in Rajasthan, aligning with PM Modi’s vision of green energy and modernization.
The foundation stones were also laid for the construction of Ramgarh Barrage and Mahalpur Barrage, and the water transfer systems from Navnera Barrage to Bisalpur Dam and Isarda Dam via aqueduct on the Chambal River, at a cost exceeding Rs 9,400 crore.
The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of solar energy in Rajasthan’s development. He announced plans for the installation of rooftop solar plants on government buildings, the development of a 2000 MW solar park and two phases of 1000 MW solar parks in Poogal (Bikaner), alongside other initiatives in renewable energy.
Additionally, PM Modi laid the foundation stone for critical infrastructure projects such as the Luni-Samdari-Bhildi Double Line, the Ajmer-Chanderiya Double Line, and the Jaipur-Sawai Madhopur Double Line railway projects, as well as a drinking water transmission line from Saipau (Dholpur) to Bharatpur and Chambal-Dholpur-Bharatpur retrofitting works.
PM Modi criticized the previous Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government for its misgovernance, accusing it of turning paper leaks and recruitment fraud into Rajasthan’s identity. “The Congress government wronged Rajasthan’s youth, but the BJP has taken strict action, arrested culprits, and ensured fair recruitments. We have also provided relief by addressing high fuel prices in the state,” he said.
A significant highlight of the event was the signing of a memorandum of agreement between the Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh governments for the modified Parvati-Kalisindh-Chambal river interlinking project, a step aimed at boosting water harvesting and conservation. The project was part of the BJP’s broader vision, tracing back to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, whose river interlinking initiatives were stalled by Congress for years.
“The BJP is committed to empowering women, youth, farmers, and the underprivileged. Connecting rivers has been a long-held dream, and now, it is becoming a reality under our governance,” PM Modi emphasized, recalling Vajpayee’s vision for water conservation.
The infrastructure projects inaugurated include green energy initiatives and enhanced rail and road connectivity. PM Modi declared that these projects would transform Rajasthan into a hub of connectivity and economic opportunity.

Title: India’s school education advances in infrastructure and digital access: Dharmendra Pradhan
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 10:28:47 +0000
Content: India’s school education system has seen steady progress over the past decade, with key initiatives focused on infrastructure development, digital inclusion, promotion of regional languages, and equity in education. Addressing a press conference in New Delhi, Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan outlined these developments, emphasizing the holistic growth in school education under the government’s leadership.
Pradhan highlighted advancements in school infrastructure between 2013-14 and 2023-24. The availability of electricity in schools increased from 53% to 91.8%, while computer access improved from 24.1% to 57.2%. Internet facilities also witnessed growth, rising from 7.3% to 53.9%. Access to basic facilities such as drinking water increased from 83.2% to 98.3%, and handwashing facilities grew from 43.1% to 94.7%. Playground availability improved from 66.9% to 82.4%, and library facilities expanded from 76.4% to 89%. The government also addressed accessibility by increasing the availability of ramps from 56.8% to 77.1% and handrails from 33.9% to 52.3%. Rainwater harvesting infrastructure was implemented in more schools, growing from 4.2% to 28.4%.
The government increased its expenditure on education. Per-child expenditure grew from ₹10,780 in 2013-14 to ₹25,043 in 2021-22, marking an upward trend in funding dedicated to school education.
The minister also discussed the promotion of Bharatiya languages in school curricula. Textbooks for Classes 1 and 2 are now available in 23 Indian languages, and multilingual e-content in 126 Indian languages and 7 foreign languages has been developed on the DIKSHA platform. The government has launched educational channels catering to diverse audiences, including a Tamil-language channel in 2024, the ULLAS channel for adult education in September 2024, and a channel for hearing-impaired learners in Indian Sign Language by December 2024.
Student performance in board examinations has shown improvements over the years. There has been a 64% increase in the number of students securing higher grades in Class X and a 66% rise in performance in Class XII board exams.
The role of women in education has also been crucial, with the number of female teachers increasing by over 30% since 2014. Between 2014 and 2024, over 61% of teaching posts have been filled by women, who now represent the majority of the teaching workforce.
Pradhan emphasized advancements in quality and equity in Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) and Navodaya Vidyalayas (NVs). The representation of rural students in NVs rose from 78% in 2014 to 90% in 2024. The introduction of OBC reservations in 2021 increased the representation of students from these backgrounds to 38.83% in NVs and 29.33% in KVs by 2024. Furthermore, more than 45,000 students from these institutions qualified for NEET, and over 2,000 students secured IIT admissions without external coaching.
The number of CBSE-affiliated schools doubled between 2014 and 2024, growing from 14,974 to 30,415. Vocational education in schools also expanded, with the number of schools offering vocational courses increasing from 960 in 2014 to 29,342 in 2024. Enrollment in vocational education grew from 58,720 in 2014 to over 30.8 lakh in 2024.
Technology-driven reforms have also streamlined various processes, including admissions, teacher transfers, and CBSE affiliations. Schools have transitioned to e-office platforms, improving administrative functions and enhancing efficiency.
Efforts to align textbooks with the National Curriculum Framework continue, with competency-based textbooks now available for seven out of 15 grades. NCERT is expanding its annual printing capacity, from 5 crore to 15 crore textbooks, to keep up with growing demand.
The government has enhanced the PM POSHAN scheme. Between 2014 and 2024, the central government allocated over ₹1.04 lakh crore to support mid-day meals in schools, compared to ₹71,525 crore allocated in the previous decade. Meal costs were revised in December 2024, increasing to ₹6.19 for primary and Balvatika classes and ₹9.29 for upper primary classes.
To further improve learning outcomes, the government has set up 32 Vidya Samiksha Kendras, with 24 integrated into the Rashtriya VSK at NCERT. The PARAKH Rashtriya Sarvekshan, an assessment of learning outcomes, was conducted in December 2024, covering 23 lakh students across over 87,000 schools.

Title: Austrian far right to lead state government in Styria for first time
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 16:50:16 +0000
Content: Austria’s far-right Freedom Party, which won a state election in Styria last month, announced a coalition deal on Tuesday that will make its leader there governor of the southern state.
It is the first time one of Austria’s nine states will be led by the eurosceptic, Russia-friendly Freedom Party (FPO) since its charismatic then-leader Joerg Haider was governor of Carinthia in the 2000s.
The three weeks it took to reach a coalition deal contrasts with national coalition talks that are still ongoing following the country’s general election on Sept. 29. The resurgent FPO has not been invited to join those talks despite coming top in the general election.
Mario Kunasek, the party’s leader in Styria, told a news conference the FPO and its future coalition partner, the conservative People’s party (OVP), had shown an ability to listen to each other and overcome their differences that “distinguishes us in our political culture from others”.
That was an apparent swipe at OVP Chancellor Karl Nehammer, who before and after September’s general election ruled out going into government with FPO leader Herbert Kickl.
The FPO secured about 29% of the national vote and would have needed a coalition partner to form a government. Since all other parliamentary parties ruled out governing with it, President Alexander Van der Bellen tasked Nehammer with forming a government. He is in coalition talks with two other parties.
Kunasek outlined some plans for Styria, ranging from local issues such as hospital provision to measures targeting “Islamism” which include a ban on religious clothing for state administration employees.

Title: New HIV prevention drug could reach poorest countries by 2025, says health official
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 16:30:25 +0000
Content: A new long-acting preventive HIV drug could reach the world’s poorest countries by the end of 2025 or early 2026, a global health official told Reuters on Tuesday.
The ambition is to start deliveries of Gilead Sciences’ lenacapavir on that timeline, said Hui Yang, head of supply operations at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. However, she said a lot of things need to happen first, including the injectable drug receiving regulatory approvals from authorities like the United States Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization.
Lenacapavir is already approved for use as a treatment for multi-drug resistant HIV, costing around $42,250 for the first year of therapy in the United States. Clinical trials this year showed it is also very effective at preventing infection and Gilead is seeking approvals for the new use globally.
“We don’t want…low and low-middle income countries to wait, to be at the back of the line,” when these approvals come in, said Yang, an equality issue that has plagued the fight against HIV for decades.
To avoid this, the Global Fund said on Tuesday it would join forces with the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), with funding from the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to support affordable access to the pricey drug in countries they work with “from day one”.
The groups did not provide further details on how this may work, other than saying they aimed to reach at least two million people over three years.
Gilead signed deals in October this year with six generic drugmakers to make and sell lenacapavir more cheaply in 120 low and middle-income countries. The move was criticized for leaving out countries, especially in Latin America.
No deal has yet been signed with Gilead or any of these generic producers, Yang said, but they will work with all the companies involved.
Gilead’s chief executive and chairman Daniel O’Day said the initiative would help accelerate access so more people could access lenacapavir from the outset.

Title: Sri Lanka can produce surplus energy, open to exporting to India: Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 15:56:40 +0000
Content: Sri Lanka has the potential to produce surplus energy and could export it to India and other neighbouring nations if new energy projects are initiated, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath said on Tuesday.
Speaking at the India Foundation Programme, Herath invited Indian companies to participate in the development of Sri Lanka’s energy sector. He said that while some energy projects are already underway, discussions are ongoing for others.
On India’s role in Sri Lanka’s energy security, Herath said, “We have surplus energy power, we have wind power and solar power. If we can start new energy projects, we can export to India and all other neighbouring countries because we have the ability to produce surplus energy. Therefore, we are in stand with the support of your companies (the Indian companies) to develop our energy sector.”
He further added that proposals and projects are currently being discussed for regions like Sampur, Mannar, and Jaffna. Herath said, “There are so many proposals out there, and we have already started some projects. We are talking with some projects because there are some technical issues in Sampur, Mannar and Jaffna. There are so many projects and proposals. Therefore, we need to finalise within a short period, and then after that, we can start those projects. After succeeding in those projects, I think, as a country we can share our energy with our neighbouring countries also. In that scenario, those projects are very valuable.”
On bilateral ties, Herath pointed to the strong relationship between India and Sri Lanka, highlighting Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s ongoing visit to India as a reflection of their shared ties.
“The current visit to India of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake is his first visit and symbolizes the closely knit bilateral ties which our nations share. India-Sri Lanka relations are founded on historical, civilizational, religious and cultural bonds. These bonds go back to time immemorial, more than 2500 years the least,” Herath said.
He elaborated on the cultural and religious links between the two nations, noting the role of Buddhism and Hinduism. “India had given us the gift of Buddhism, which gave rise to a flourishing Buddhist civilization in the island more than two millennia ago, and the influence of Hinduism was built into our socio-cultural fabric over the centuries of movement of people and interactions. Along with these religions, literature, languages, architecture, sculpture and agrarian economy, etc. developed in Sri Lanka.”
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake held a meeting at Hyderabad House in Delhi on Monday.

Title: NTA to focus only on entrance exams for higher education, says Dharmendra Pradhan
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:32:22 +0000
Content: The National Testing Agency (NTA) will conduct only entrance exams for higher education institutions from 2025, Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Tuesday. He clarified that NTA will no longer conduct recruitment examinations.
 
“We are working towards technology-driven entrance exams that ensure zero error and minimize irregularities,” Pradhan said while addressing reporters at his residence. 
 
He also announced the restructuring of NTA to improve its efficiency and credibility. “We have started the process of restructuring the NTA by creating new posts and appointing new officers. This will bring fresh energy into the organization,” he added.
 
The restructuring follows recommendations from a high-level committee led by former ISRO Chairman Dr. K. Radhakrishnan. The committee, formed in June after the NEET-undergraduate paper leak, submitted its report to the Ministry of Education on October 21.
 
The committee, constituted on June 22, held around 30 meetings and proposed 101 recommendations to ensure the fair and smooth conduct of examinations. 
 
The committee also proposed the creation of a Grievance Reporting and Redressal Cell (GRRC) to address issues faced by students during exams. “Given the scale of exams like JEE and NEET, which see participation from millions of students, this is a critical step,” Pradhan said.
 
Addressing student concerns, Pradhan stressed the need for measures to tackle mental health challenges and ensure timely declaration of results. He said, “Mental health will be a focus.”
 
On the issue of exam security, Pradhan pointed out that robust cybersecurity measures were necessary. The committee proposed dynamic solutions to secure question papers and prevent irregularities.
 
The reforms also include simplifying the admission process under the Common University Entrance Test (CUET) and regulating coaching centers to address their commercialization. “We want to ensure coaching centers are not misused by market forces,” he added.
 
To facilitate the reforms, the committee suggested leveraging public testing infrastructure, such as schools and local colleges, and engaging in continuous research on psychometrics.
 
Dr. Radhakrishnan has been requested to lead a three-member high-power steering committee to oversee these changes.
 
Starting in 2025, entrance exams will take place earlier in the academic year, moving from the usual July timeline to January or February. Pradhan clarified that while the Health Ministry will determine how exams like NEET are conducted, the NTA, as a service provider, will focus on zero-error execution.
 
The committee’s establishment followed the NEET-UG paper leak, which led to a CBI investigation that identified 144 candidates who allegedly paid to access leaked and solved exam papers. This scandal, coupled with the cancellation or postponement of exams like UGC-NET, prompted widespread criticism and demands for reforms.
 
“We have taken extensive feedback from parents, technologists, state administrators, and cybersecurity experts. This is a collective effort to make the examination system more robust and student-friendly,” Pradhan concluded.

Title: Combined liver, kidney transplant successfully done on 54-year-old man in Hyderabad
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 13:14:20 +0000
Content: Star Hospitals has successfully performed a simultaneous liver and kidney transplant on a 54-year-old critically ill patient, Rama Rao, a businessman from Ongole, Andhra Pradesh.  
 
The patient suffered from liver and kidney failure, compounded by multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, and hepatitis B infection. Diagnosed with liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, his condition worsened over time, leading to water retention in the body (ascites) and kidney failure, further complicating his health.  
 
Admitted to Star Hospitals’ Hepatology and Liver Transplant department, he presented with severe infection, low blood pressure, hepatic coma, and toxin accumulation in the blood due to combined liver and kidney failure. With less than a 10% chance of survival in such cases, stabilising the patient in the ICU and performing an urgent simultaneous liver and kidney transplant was critical.  
 
This extraordinary feat was made possible by the patient’s family, who demonstrated remarkable selflessness. The patient’s spouse donated a kidney, while his son donated a portion of his liver.  
 
The complex 12-hour surgery involved simultaneous operations on both donors and the patient in adjacent operating theatres. Both donors were discharged within a week in excellent condition, while the patient experienced a smooth recovery, marking a new lease on life.  
 
Dr. Mettu Srinivas Reddy, Director and Lead Surgeon at Star Liver Institute, highlighted the case’s complexity: “Multi-organ transplantation is a highly challenging procedure, especially for critically ill patients. Successfully conducting such a surgery using two family donors demands exceptional technical expertise and coordination. Our interdisciplinary team of over 50 specialists worked seamlessly to ensure success.”  
 
Dr. Golamari Srinivasa Reddy, Clinical Lead Consultant for Hepatology and Transplant Hepatology, explained the challenges in managing the patient: “Severe liver cirrhosis and kidney failure, especially when complicated by infection, can be fatal without immediate treatment. This case underlines the importance of specialised liver intensive care and screening for hepatitis B to prevent such conditions.”  
 
Dr. Sridhar, Director of Nephrology and Renal Transplant, emphasised the need for a kidney transplant: “With the patient’s kidney function severely impaired, a kidney transplant was vital. Without it, he would have required frequent dialysis, even post-liver transplant. A simultaneous procedure was crucial for sustainable recovery.”  
 
Dr. Ravindranath, Chief Mentor at Star Liver Institute, lauded the hospital’s capabilities: “This successful multi-organ transplant showcases the unmatched expertise of our medical team and our advanced facilities, making Star Hospitals a preferred destination for complex healthcare needs.

Title: Over 57,000 sewer and septic tank workers identified under NAMASTE scheme
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 12:18:06 +0000
Content: The National Action for Mechanised Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) scheme has profiled over 57,758 Sewer and Septic Tank Workers (SSWs) across India, with 54,574 workers validated so far, Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment, Ramdas Athawale, informed the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.
The initiative, launched in the 2023-24 fiscal year, seeks to ensure safety, dignity, and socio-economic empowerment for sanitation workers. It is being implemented across more than 4,800 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) under a collaboration between the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJ&E) and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).
The data reveals that sanitation work remains deeply entrenched in social inequalities, with 67.91% of the workers coming from Scheduled Castes (SC), followed by 15.73% from Other Backward Classes (OBC), 8.31% from Scheduled Tribes (ST), and 8.05% from the General category.
Over 16,791 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits and 43 safety devices kits for Emergency Response Sanitation Units (ERSUs) have been distributed to improve worker safety. Health benefits have been extended to 13,604 workers and their families through Ayushman cards. A capital subsidy of Rs. 13.96 crore has been granted to 503 sanitation workers and dependents for sanitation-related projects. Additionally, Rs. 2.85 crore has been disbursed to 226 workers for alternative self-employment opportunities. 837 workshops have been conducted across municipalities to raise awareness of safe sanitation practices and to train workers on preventing hazardous cleaning methods.
To eradicate unsafe manual cleaning practices, the government has focused on mechanization. Under the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 (SBM-U 2.0), Rs. 371 crore has been allocated to 26 states and Union Territories for procuring 2,585 desludging vehicles. This mechanization is expected to reduce health hazards and improve efficiency in sanitation work.
Furthermore, guidelines have been issued by MoHUA to all states and UTs, emphasizing strict safety procedures, the establishment of ERSUs, and the use of modern equipment for sewer and septic tank cleaning.
The integration of data from states like Tamil Nadu and Odisha into the central NAMASTE database is currently underway to ensure a more comprehensive outreach. The government is actively working to expand the scheme’s benefits to all sanitation workers nationwide.

Title: Western governments expand contacts with Syria’s new leadership
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 12:10:20 +0000
Content: German and French officials are due to meet representatives of Syria’s new governing authorities in Damascus on Tuesday, expanding Western contacts with the new administration after British diplomats met its leader Ahmed al-Sharaa late on Monday.
Nine days after Bashar al-Assad was ousted, the new prime minister installed by Sharaa’s Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group said the government was grappling with very low currency reserves and called for sanctions to be lifted.
Western states are gradually opening channels to the new authorities in Damascus led by HTS, though they continue to designate it as a terrorist group.
Late on Monday, Sharaa, formerly known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, met a British foreign ministry delegation. He stressed the need for the restoration of ties and lifting sanctions on Syria so that Syrian refugees can return home, the Syrian state news agency SANA reported.
Photos published by SANA showed Sharaa, whose group was part of al Qaeda until he broke ties in 2016, sitting in a suit with an open shirt during the meeting, his highest level encounter yet with a Western government official since HTS seized power.
The images underline the geopolitical shift since Assad was toppled by HTS-led forces, a blow to Assad’s Russian and Iranian allies which could potentially open the way for Western states to reopen contacts with Damascus.
But for now at least, any Western overtures require manoeuvring around both the terrorism designation imposed on HTS during its days as an al Qaeda affiliate and financial sanctions imposed on Damascus under Assad.
Sharaa “spoke about the need to build a state of law and institutions, and establishing security,” SANA reported. “He also spoke about Britain’s important role internationally.”
Ahead of the meeting, British foreign minister David Lammy said London had sent a delegation of senior officials to Damascus to meet with the new interim Syrian authorities and civil society groups.
German diplomats are also planning talks with representatives of HTS in Damascus on Tuesday, the German foreign ministry said.
A German foreign ministry spokesperson said the talks would focus on a transitional process for Syria and the protection of minorities.
“The possibilities of a diplomatic presence in Damascus are also being explored there,” the spokesperson added in a statement, reiterating that Berlin was monitoring HTS closely in light of its roots in al Qaeda ideology.
“As far as one can tell, they have acted prudently so far,” the spokesperson said.
The new administration in Damascus has set out few details on its thinking for the next steps, even as it has swiftly established control over state institutions.
The justice of Islam
In an interview with Al Jazeera Mubasher, the newly installed Prime Minister Mohammed al-Bashir said the defence ministry would be restructured using using former rebel factions and officers who defected from Assad’s army.
Asked what he would say to those worried about a single religious or political group dominating Syria, Bashir said: “Those who are afraid…of a religion trend or anything else doesn’t truly understand Islam, the forgiveness of Islam, the justice of Islam”.
“Syria is for all Syrians,” he said. “Everyone is a partner for us building the Syria of the future.”
Bashir, who formerly led an HTS-affiliated government in Idlib province, has said he will remain in office until March.
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on Monday the European Union should be ready to ease sanctions on Syria if the country’s new leadership takes “positive steps” to establish an inclusive government and respect women’s and minority rights.
The Syrian conflict, which spiralled out of 2011 uprising against Assad’s repressive rule, drove millions of Syrians abroad as refugees, including around 1 million who went to Germany.
French diplomats are also expected to visit Damascus later on Tuesday to meet HTS representatives, French officials said.
The U.S. State Department said on Monday that the U.S. government has had more than one communication with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) over the past week.

Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:56:30 +0000
Content: South Korean investigators probing President Yoon Suk Yeol’s short-lived martial law declaration failed to gain entry to his office to seek evidence on Tuesday after presidential office security staff denied them entry, Yonhap news agency reported.
Yoon was impeached on Saturday over his martial law decree and suspended from his presidential duties. Yonhap said that investigators looking for evidence about the legality of Yoon’s martial law decision waited for about seven hours to be let in, but the presidential office security service denied them entry.
A joint investigation team including police and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) was trying to access computer servers of the presidential office’s security service to get records of phones including one used by the police commissioner, Yonhap said, citing the team.
This would be the second time authorities have tried and failed to raid the presidential office over the declaration of martial law that was reversed within hours after a standoff with parliament.
An attempt on Dec. 11 ended without entry, but the presidential office voluntarily submitted some data.
The presidential office’s security service said it would express its position on Wednesday concerning cooperation with raids, Yonhap reported.
The police and the presidential office did not have an immediate comment on Tuesday. The CIO declined to comment.
Since his last public remarks shortly after he was impeached by parliament in a vote on Saturday, Yoon has kept a low profile and authorities and the Constitutional Court have not been able to contact or summon him, according to the court and officials.
Yoon has been putting together legal teams to defend himself against accusations of insurrection and in the Constitutional Court case which will decide whether to remove him from office or restore his powers.
Seok Dong-Hyun, a lawyer and an ex-prosecutor who helps Yoon, told reporters on Tuesday that the president’s declaration of martial law did not constitute insurrection, Yonhap reported.
Yoon would also “confidently express his position in the (Constitutional) Court”, Yonhap cited Seok as saying.
Seok declined to say whether Yoon would comply with a summons to appear for questioning on Dec. 21, and said authorities needed to streamline current investigations being conducted by several agencies at once, including the prosecution, the police and the CIO, Yonhap reported.
Seok could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters.
Meanwhile, South Korea’s acting president Han Duck-soo on Tuesday called during a cabinet meeting for next year’s government budget to be swiftly implemented from the start of 2025 in order to help revive the country’s slowing economy.
Han has been working to reassure South Korea’s allies and calm financial markets since taking over the duties of Yoon after the president was impeached.
The government has decided to frontload 75% of its 2025 budget to be implemented during the first half of the year, the finance ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
South Korea faces economic challenges, including heightened uncertainty for the trade-dependent country created by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to hike tariffs, as export growth in Asia’s fourth-largest economy slowed for a fourth-straight month in November, to the weakest level in 14 months.
The foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday it launched a task force to respond to the new Trump administration’s foreign policies.

Title: Mayotte authorities fear hunger, disease after cyclone; death toll rises in Mozambique
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:36:00 +0000
Content: Authorities in Mayotte were racing on Tuesday to stop hunger, disease and lawlessness from spreading in the French overseas territory after the weekend’s devastating cyclone, while Mozambique reported dozens of deaths from the storm.
Hundreds or even thousands could be dead in Mayotte, which took the strongest hit from Cyclone Chido, French officials have said. The storm laid waste to large parts of the archipelago off east Africa, France’s poorest overseas territory, before striking continental Africa.
With many parts of Mayotte still inaccessible and some victims buried before their deaths could be officially counted, it may take days to discover the full extent of the destruction.
So far, 22 deaths and more than 1,400 injuries have been confirmed, Ambdilwahedou Soumaila, the mayor of the capital Mamoudzou, told Radio France Internationale on Tuesday morning.
“The priority today is water and food,” Soumaila said. “There are people who have unfortunately died where the bodies are starting to decompose that can create a sanitary problem.”
“We don’t have electricity. When night falls, there are people who take advantage of that situation.”
Twenty tonnes of food and water are due to start arriving on Tuesday by air and sea. The French government said late on Monday it expects 50% of water supplies to be restored within 48 hours and 95% within the week.
France’s interior ministry announced that a curfew would go into effect on Tuesday night from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. local time.
Rescue workers have been searching for survivors amid the debris of shantytowns bowled over by 200 kph (124 mph) winds.
Chido was the strongest storm to strike Mayotte in more than 90 years, French weather service Meteo France said. In Mozambique, it killed at least 34 people, officials said on Tuesday. Another seven died in Malawi.
Drone footage from Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado province, already experiencing a humanitarian crisis due to an Islamist insurgency, showed razed thatched-roof houses near the beach and personal belongings scattered under the few palm trees still standing.
Illegal Immigration
French President Emmanuel Macron said after an emergency cabinet meeting on Monday that he would visit Mayotte in the coming days, as the disaster quickly fuelled a political back-and-forth about immigration, the environment and France’s treatment of its overseas territories.
Mayotte has been grappling with unrest in recent years, with many residents angry at illegal immigration and inflation.
More than three-quarters of its roughly 321,000 people live in relative poverty, and about one-third are estimated to be undocumented migrants, most from nearby Comoros and Madagascar.
The territory has become a stronghold for the far-right National Rally with 60% voting for Marine Le Pen in the 2022 presidential election runoff.
France’s acting Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, from the conservative Republicans party, told a news conference in Mayotte that the early warning system had worked “perfectly” but many of the undocumented had not come to designated shelters.
Other officials have said undocumented migrants may have been afraid to go to shelters for fear of being arrested.
The toll of the cyclone, Retailleau said in a later post on X, underscored the need to address “the migration question”.
“Mayotte is the symbol of the drift that (French) governments have allowed to take hold on this issue,” he said. “We will need to legislate so that in Mayotte, like everywhere else on the national territory, France retakes control of its immigration.”
Left-wing politicians, however, have pointed the finger at what they say is the government’s neglect of Mayotte and failure to prepare for natural disasters linked to climate change.
Socialist Party chairman Olivier Faure blasted Retailleau’s comments in an X post.
“He could have interrogated the role of climate change in producing more and more intense climate disasters. He could have rallied against the extreme poverty that makes people more vulnerable to cyclones,” said Faure.
“No, he has resumed his crusade against migrants.”
Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, appointed last week to steer France out of a political crisis, faced criticism after he went to the town of Pau, where he is the mayor, to attend a municipal council meeting on Monday, instead of visiting Mayotte.

Title: Indian spin legend Ashwin hangs up his boots from international cricket
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 07:01:55 +0000
Content: By: Aditya Ahuja
India’s spin maestro, Ravichandran Ashwin, announced his retirement from international cricket across all formats after the third Test against Australia in Brisbane ended in a draw on Wednesday.
Ashwin, one of India’s most successful bowlers, retires with an impressive 537 wickets from 106 Test matches, making him the second-highest wicket-taker among Indian bowlers, behind only Anil Kumble, who has 619 wickets.
Although Ashwin was not selected for the opening Test in Perth, he made a return to the team for the day-night second Test in Adelaide, where he took a solitary wicket. That match ultimately proved to be his final Test appearance after he was omitted from the lineup for the Brisbane game.
“This will be my last day as an Indian cricketer in all formats at the international level,” the 38-year-old Ashwin said, addressing the media at the Gabba. “I do feel there’s a bit of punch left in me as a cricketer, but I would like to showcase that at the club level.”
Ashwin, who has been a key figure in India’s success over the years, expressed his gratitude for the memories created alongside teammates, including India captain Rohit Sharma. “I had a lot of fun. I must say, I created a lot of memories alongside Rohit and several of my other teammates,” he added, with Sharma standing by his side.
Apart from his remarkable Test career, Ashwin has also played 116 One-Day Internationals (ODIs) and 65 Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is), taking a total of 765 wickets across all formats.
Known for his skillful off-spin, Ashwin was a match-winner on India’s turning tracks and also emerged as a reliable Test all-rounder, scoring six centuries in the format.

Title: INS Nirdeshak to be commissioned in Visakhapatnam
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 07:01:13 +0000
Content: The Indian Navy is set to welcome its newest vessel, INS Nirdeshak, in a commissioning ceremony on Wednesday at the Naval Dockyard in Visakhapatnam. The event will be presided over by Minister of State for Defence Sanjay Seth.
According to the Ministry of Defence, INS Nirdeshak is the second ship under the Survey Vessel (Large) Project, constructed at Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) in Kolkata. Notably, over 80% of the vessel’s components are indigenously produced, reinforcing India’s commitment to self-reliance in defence manufacturing.
The ship pays tribute to its predecessor, the original Nirdeshak, which served the Indian Navy for 32 years before being decommissioned in 2014. The new vessel is designed to carry forward the legacy, boasting advanced operational capabilities, including an endurance of 25 days at sea and a top speed exceeding 18 knots.
The Ministry of Defence highlighted that the commissioning of INS Nirdeshak is a significant step in modernising the Indian Navy’s hydrographic fleet. The ship will also bolster the nation’s SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) initiative, aligning with India’s strategic focus on regional security and scientific exploration.
The ceremony will be hosted by Vice Admiral Rajesh Pendharkar, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Eastern Naval Command, and will be attended by senior naval officials, representatives from GRSE, and other dignitaries.

Title: Regulating OTTs comes under preview of I&B ministry, concerns of Telecom Service Providers have been raised: Jyotiraditya Scindia
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 06:56:01 +0000
Content: The regulation of over-the-top (OTT) platforms falls under the jurisdiction of the Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Ministry, Union Minister for Communications Jyotiraditya Scindia said in an interview with ANI. Scindia also said that one of the six advisory groups he established had flagged concerns regarding OTT platforms, particularly from the perspective of Telecom Service Providers (TSPs).
Scindia said, “That is something that, to be very candid, comes under the domain of the Ministry of I&B. Having said that, I have six advisory groups that I have set up and this concept has come up as an issue that they would like to discuss from the point of view of the TSPs.”
The ongoing debate centers around the idea of OTT platforms sharing the costs incurred by TSPs in delivering content to consumers. TSPs argue that such cost-sharing arrangements could help finance necessary investments in expanding network infrastructure. On the other hand, critics warn that such measures may violate the principles of net neutrality, which mandates equal treatment of all internet traffic.
Net neutrality prohibits content providers from making payments to TSPs, arguing that introducing such payments could enable network operators to prioritize specific platforms, undermining the internet’s open and democratic nature. Critics stress that such practices could disproportionately benefit larger platforms and harm smaller players in the digital ecosystem.
Proponents of cost-sharing, however, point to the rapid evolution of the digital economy and telecom sector. From 2015 to 2023, India witnessed an exponential increase in mobile data consumption, with average usage per user rising from 0.09 GB to 17.36 GB per month. Despite this surge, network infrastructure has struggled to keep up. Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are expected to further drive up data usage, increasing the demand for network upgrades.
Advocates for cost-sharing argue that the current net neutrality framework may no longer be adequate to address these evolving challenges. They propose a more nuanced approach that balances the interests of all stakeholders involved. For example, larger OTT platforms with significant revenue streams, such as subscription fees and advertising, could be required to contribute to network costs, while smaller or less profitable platforms might be exempt in order to foster innovation and competition.
Furthermore, any new framework would need to address potential contractual disputes between TSPs and OTT platforms, as well as safeguard against monopolistic practices that could harm smaller players in the market.
One proposed solution to these challenges is extending the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI) interconnection regulations to OTT platforms. This would create clear rules for how OTTs and TSPs interact, ensuring transparency and fairness while preserving net neutrality principles related to quality of service.

Title: India finish on high note as rain ensures Gabba Test ends in stalemate
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 06:26:45 +0000
Content: India may thank the heavens after rain cut short Australia’s push for victory on the final day of the third test in Brisbane on Wednesday, raising the stakes for Melbourne where the series shifts for the traditional ‘Boxing Day’ clash.
India were eight for no loss when tea was called early due to failing light at the Gabba, with the tourists needing 267 runs for victory.
With a heavy downpour preventing the resumption of play after the break, the match was abandoned and the series remains locked at 1-1.
“We’ll take that, obviously,” said India captain Rohit Sharma at the post-match presentation.
“We head to Melbourne with the confidence that we can try to pull things toward us.”
Captain Pat Cummins had declared Australia’s second innings closed at 89 for seven to give India an improbable 275-run victory target as dark clouds gathered near the ground.
Cummins and fellow pacer Mitchell Starc bowled only 2.1 overs at the Indian openers before play was halted.
Yashasvi Jaiswal was four not out, with KL Rahul also on four.
“Unfortunately a lot of rain, which you can’t do anything about… I’m really proud of how the guys played,” said Cummins.
“We were right ahead of the game…. We just about ticked off every box we could.”
Australia bowled out India for 260 after scoring a first innings 445, with rain blighting the match throughout.
After capturing India’s final wicket in the first hour on day five, Australia led by 185 runs but rain denied them the chance to bat until after lunch.
In search of quick runs, Australia crashed to 33 for five as Akash Deep and Jasprit Bumrah removed the top four for single-digit scores, a day after the pacemen combined in a brave 10th-wicket partnership to ensure India would avoid the follow-on.
Travis Head and Alex Carey (19 not out) briefly stemmed the bleeding with a 27-run partnership before Head top-edged Mohammed Siraj to be out for 17.
Cummins slogged 22 off 10 balls before becoming Bumrah’s third wicket and declared five balls later.
Australia’s hopes of forcing a result were always hostage to the weather but their chances of victory were already wafer-thin given their attack was a man down.
Pace stalwart Josh Hazlewood was out of action after succumbing to a calf injury, while there were also concerns about all-rounder Mitchell Marsh’s fitness after he bowled only two overs in the match.
Travis Head was named Player of the Match after scoring 152 in Australia’s first innings, having also scored a big hundred in the hosts’ second test win in Adelaide.

Title: India unveils Kisan Kavach: Revolutionary anti-pesticide suit to safeguard farmers
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 06:22:03 +0000
Content: Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Tuesday launched Kisan Kavach, India’s first indigenous anti-pesticide bodysuit, designed to protect farmers from harmful pesticide exposure. This innovative suit aims to significantly improve farmer safety and marks a major advancement in agricultural and health technology.
Developed by BRIC-inStem, Bengaluru, in collaboration with Sepio Health Pvt. Ltd., Kisan Kavach uses advanced fabric technology to neutralize harmful pesticides on contact. It provides protection against pesticide-induced toxicity, which can cause serious health problems such as respiratory disorders, vision impairment, and fatalities.
Singh described the suit as a crucial step toward safeguarding farmers’ health and praised the Department of Biotechnology and BRIC-inStem for their efforts in developing this project. The suit aligns with the government’s vision of leveraging technology to support farmers and strengthen the agricultural sector.
The suit is washable, reusable, and priced at ₹4,000. It is designed to last up to a year and utilizes nucleophile-based fabric technology to deactivate pesticides, as detailed in a report published in Nature Communications. Its production involves attaching nucleophilic molecules to cotton fabric to create a durable protective layer.
During the launch event, the first batch of Kisan Kavach suits was distributed to farmers. Singh emphasized that scaled-up production would make the suits more affordable and accessible to farmers across the country.
Given that a large portion of India’s population depends on agriculture, Kisan Kavach is expected to make a transformative impact. Singh also highlighted the government’s commitment to integrating innovation into agriculture, citing the BioE3 biomanufacturing initiative and the growth of over 8,500 biotech startups as key examples.

Title: Japan’s Space One Kairos rocket fails minutes after liftoff
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 05:54:47 +0000
Content: Japan’s Space One terminated the flight of its Kairos small rocket shortly after liftoff on Wednesday, marking the end of its second attempt in nine months to become the country’s first company to deliver a satellite to space.
It is the latest in a series of recent setbacks for Japanese rocket development, even as the government looks to boost the domestic space industry and is targeting 30 rocket launches annually by the early 2030s.
Authorities are pushing to make Japan Asia’s space transportation hub in what they hope will be an 8 trillion yen ($52 billion) space industry.
The second Kairos flight, which only lasted about 10 minutes, was terminated because “the achievement of its mission would be difficult”, Space One said in an email to reporters.
Live images from the local Wakayama prefecture government showed the 18-metre (59 ft) solid-propellant rocket blasting off from Spaceport Kii in western Japan at 11:00 a.m. (0200 GMT) but losing stability in its trajectory as it ascended.
Five small satellites, including one from the Taiwan Space Agency, were on board the rocket headed into sun-synchronous orbit roughly 500 km (311 miles) above the Earth’s surface.
Space One is investigating the incident and will host a press conference at 2:30 p.m. local time, the company said.
Tokyo-based Space One was founded in 2018 by Canon Electronics, T aerospace unit, construction firm Shimizu and a state-backed bank, with the goal of launching 20 small rockets a year by 2029 to capture growing satellite launch demand.
At its debut flight in March, Kairos, carrying a Japanese government satellite,exploded five seconds after launch.
Inappropriate flight settings triggered the rocket’s autonomous self-destruct system even though no issues were found in its hardware, Space One later said.
A lack of domestic launch options has seen emerging Japanese space startups such as radar satellite maker iQPS and debris mitigator Astroscale tapping on SpaceX’s rideshare missions or leading small rocket provider Rocket Lab.
Recent Japanese rocket projects have also faced other setbacks.
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) postponed the debut flight of the new solid-fuel launcher Epsilon S after its engine combustion test failed last month for a second time.
JAXA’s larger liquid-propellant rocket H3 also failed at its inaugural launch in March 2023 but has succeeded in three flights this year, winning orders from clients such as French satellite giant Eutelsat.
In 2019, Interstellar Technologies became the first Japanese firm to send a rocket into space without a satellite payload, but its orbital launcher Zero is still under development.

Title: Gaza ceasefire talks gain momentum as officials push for deal
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 05:16:02 +0000
Content: An agreement to halt the 14-month-old war in Gaza and free hostages held in the Palestinian enclave could be signed in the coming days with talks in Cairo making progress, sources briefed on the meeting said on Tuesday.
The U.S. administration, joined by mediators from Egypt and Qatar, has made intensive efforts in recent days to advance the talks before President Joe Biden leaves office next month.
“We believe – and the Israelis have said this – that we’re getting closer, and no doubt about it, we believe that, but we also are cautious in our optimism,” White House spokesperson John Kirby said in an interview with Fox News.
“We’ve been in this position before where we weren’t able to get it over the finish line.”
The sources said a ceasefire deal could be days away that would stop the fighting and return hostages held by the Islamist movement Hamas in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
CIA Director William Burns, a key U.S. negotiator, was due in Doha on Wednesday for talks with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani on bridging remaining gaps between Israel and Hamas, other knowledgeable sources told Reuters.
The CIA declined to comment.
Hamas said in a statement a deal was possible if Israel stopped setting new conditions. A Palestinian official close to the mediation efforts said negotiations were serious, with discussions under way about every word.
Sources briefed on the meeting said Netanyahu was on his way to Cairo, but a statement from Netanyahu’s office said he had a meeting on Tuesday with senior military and security officials on Mount Hermon, a strategic plateau just inside Syria.
Separately, his spokesperson messaged Israeli correspondents to say: “The prime minister is not in Cairo.”
Two Egyptian security sources said that Netanyahu was not in Cairo “at this moment” but that a meeting was under way to work through the remaining points, chief among them a Hamas demand for guarantees that any immediate deal would lead to a comprehensive agreement later.
The Egyptian sources said they were making progress and felt that Tuesday night could be decisive in setting the next steps.
Netanyahu had been excused on Tuesday from giving previously scheduled testimony at his corruption trial. He met in Israel on Monday with Adam Boehler, designated by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to be his special envoy for hostage affairs.
At a press conference in Florida on Monday, Trump reiterated his threat that “all hell is going to break out” if Hamas does not release its hostages by Jan. 20, the day he takes office.
Later, Trump said that if no ceasefire deal is reached by the time he takes office, “It’s not going to be pleasant.” He did not elaborate.
U.S. and Israeli officials have expressed growing optimism that negotiations brokered by Egypt and Qatar could produce a deal by the end of the month but have also cautioned that the talks could fall through.
Israeli negotiators were in Doha on Monday looking to bridge gaps between Israel and Hamas on a deal Biden outlined in May.
There have been repeated rounds of talks over the past year, all of which have ended in failure, with Israel insisting on retaining a military presence in Gaza and Hamas refusing to release hostages until the troops pulled out.
The war in Gaza, triggered by a Hamas-led attack on communities in southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people and saw more than 250 abducted as hostages, has sent shockwaves across the Middle East and left Israel isolated internationally.
Israel’s campaign has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, displaced most of the 2.3 million population and reduced much of the coastal enclave to ruins.
Israeli airstrikes killed extended families in homes in two parts of the northern Gaza Strip on Tuesday, medics said.
At least 10 people were confirmed killed in an airstrike on a house in Gaza City that destroyed the building, while further north in the town of Beit Lahiya at least 15 people were believed to be dead or missing under the rubble of a house hit around dawn.

Title: French President Macron thanks PM Modi for India’s support after Cyclone Chido hits Mayotte
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 04:58:41 +0000
Content: French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday after India extended support in the aftermath of cyclone Chido, a devastating storm that struck the French archipelago of Mayotte on Saturday.
According to Meteo-France, Cyclone Chido is the strongest storm to hit Mayotte in over 90 years. The catastrophic winds flattened entire neighborhoods, destroyed electrical grids, and severely damaged critical infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, and the airport’s control tower.
Prime Minister Modi had earlier expressed his condolences, saying, “Deeply saddened by the devastation caused by Cyclone Chido in Mayotte. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. I am confident that under President Emmanuel Macron’s leadership, France will overcome this tragedy with resilience and resolve. India stands in solidarity with France and is ready to extend all possible assistance.”
Responding to PM Modi’s message, President Macron said, “Thank you for your thoughts and support, dear Narendra Modi.”
Cyclone Chido, a Category 4 storm, caused extensive damage as it swept through the southwestern Indian Ocean over the weekend. The cyclone first impacted northern Madagascar before intensifying rapidly and making landfall in Mayotte, with wind speeds exceeding 220 km/h (136 mph).
The storm, which affected the archipelago of over 300,000 residents, continued its destructive path into northern Mozambique, where it caused further damage before gradually weakening.
French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou commented during an inter-ministerial meeting, “Everyone understands that this was an unexpectedly violent cyclone.”
The toll from the storm has been staggering, with officials fearing fatalities could reach the thousands. Prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville stated, “I think there will definitely be several hundred, perhaps we will come close to a thousand or even several thousand deaths,” as reported by broadcaster Mayotte la Premiere.
Initial reports confirmed at least 11 deaths, but the numbers are expected to rise as rescue efforts continue.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) expressed concern on Tuesday about more than 200 of its volunteers feared missing in Mayotte after Cyclone Chido devastated the islands.
“Winds of up to 220 km/h caused by Cyclone Chido have devastated the French overseas territory of Mayotte. It’s feared that more than 200 … volunteers are missing,” the IFRC said on X.

Title: 28 indian fishermen return home after repatriation from Bahrain
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 13:28:45 +0000
Content: The Indian Embassy in Bahrain has announced the repatriation of 28 Indian fishermen who were recently detained in the country. The fishermen, initially sentenced to six months in prison, had their terms reduced to three months, allowing for their earlier release.
The embassy, in a post on X, shared the update, saying, “India in Bahrain is pleased to announce repatriation of 28 Indian fishermen who were recently freed after reduction in sentence from 6 to 3 months. The embassy facilitated legal assistance and travel under GoI’s Indian Community Welfare Fund. Well-being of Indian nationals is our priority.”
The Indian Embassy also thanked the Bahraini authorities for “cooperation.” In another post on X, it wrote, “We thank the Bahraini authorities for cooperation & swift response including for providing consular access. Wishing them a safe return to their families in India.”
Earlier on September 26, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin urged External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to take immediate diplomatic initiatives to ensure consular access and legal assistance to secure an early release of 28 fishermen from the Idinthakarai fishing village of Tirunelveli district apprehended by the Bahrain Coast Guard on September 11.
In his letter, Stalin highlighted that the fishermen, employed in Iran, were apprehended by Bahrain’s Coast Guard on September 11 for allegedly crossing maritime borders. He noted that the boats they were operating belonged to Iranian nationals, and their arrest had severely impacted their families, who rely on their income.
“The families of the fishermen, who are highly dependent on their income, have been severely impacted by the arrest,” he said.
CM Stalin had also requested the EAM Jaishankar to take immediate diplomatic initiatives to ensure consular access and legal assistance to secure the early release of the arrested fishermen. (ANI)

Title: India reveals ambitious space station plans, accelerates private-sector role
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:10:47 +0000
Content: India is accelerating its space ambitions with the announcement of the Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS), a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space station designed to establish a sustained human presence in space. The station aims to support medium- to long-duration human spaceflight missions and enable advanced scientific research and technology development in microgravity.
Union Minister of State for Science and Technology Dr Jitendra Singh revealed on Wednesday that the first module of BAS, known as BAS-01, is scheduled for launch in 2028. The station is expected to become fully operational by 2035. This milestone is part of a broader expansion of the Gaganyaan programme, which now includes precursor missions to BAS, reflecting India’s growing capabilities in human spaceflight.
In addition to the BAS project, the central government has been actively fostering private-sector participation in the space sector to drive innovation and large-scale investment. The Indian government estimates that the nation’s space economy, currently valued at $8.4 billion and representing 2-3% of the global market, has the potential to reach $44 billion by 2033, with private-sector involvement playing a crucial role in achieving this growth.
The liberalised space policy now allows non-governmental entities to undertake comprehensive space activities. To facilitate this, the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) was established to promote, authorise, and oversee private-sector involvement.
The government has implemented a range of initiatives to encourage private-sector growth. These include the Indian Space Policy 2023, which offers regulatory certainty for stakeholders, and a ₹1,000 crore venture capital fund dedicated to supporting space start-ups. IN-SPACe has also introduced various support schemes, including seed funding, mentorship, and skill development programmes, as well as facilitating technology transfers for small satellite launch vehicles and Earth observation systems.
The impact of these efforts is evident in the growth of space start-ups in India, which have increased from just one in 2014 to 266 today. IN-SPACe has signed 71 agreements with private entities, enabling them to contribute to the development of launch vehicles and satellites. 
Additionally, initiatives such as public-private partnerships in Earth observation systems and revised FDI policies are further opening doors for foreign investment in the Indian space sector.
India’s Department of Space has also been advancing ground station capabilities. It has successfully developed a Tri-band Data Reception System that enables cost-effective tracking and data reception from remote sensing satellites. These capabilities have been leveraged to support 17 satellite and launch vehicle missions on a commercial basis.
The Department of Space has made Earth observation data widely accessible. Data with a spatial resolution of five metres is available for free, while higher-resolution data is offered at no cost to government entities and at fair prices to private players.
NSIL, ISRO’s commercial arm, has been providing tracking facilities and satellite data services to domestic and international clients as part of its “Ground Station as a Service” initiative. This reflects the increasing commercialisation of India’s space capabilities.
To streamline processes for private players, IN-SPACe is exploring the creation of a single-window interface for authorisations, approvals, and licences, aimed at reducing administrative hurdles for companies operating in the space sector.

Title: Cricket community lauds Ashwin after he calls time on his international career
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:08:34 +0000
Content: The cricketing fraternity took to social media to praise 38-year-old off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin after he announced his retirement from Test cricket, following the conclusion of the Brisbane Test at the Gabba on Wednesday.
Former India cricketer Dinesh Karthik, who shared the dressing room with Ashwin both internationally and domestically, commended him on his remarkable career. “A GOAT retires. Well done on what’s been an outstanding career. Proud to have played with you and definitely the greatest ever to have played from Tamil Nadu @ashwinravi99. Much love and enjoy some leisurely time with family and friends,” Karthik wrote on X.
West Indies legend Ian Bishop lauded Ashwin’s contributions during his illustrious 14-year international career. “Thank you, Ravi Ashwin. Glad you came, and that you were a part of the international game for so long, with such excellence. You taught, you educated, and you entertained,” Ian Bishop wrote on X.
Former India captain and leg-spinner, Anil Kumble, congratulated Ashwin on his “stellar” career. “@ashwinravi99 your journey has been nothing short of extraordinary! With over 700 international wickets and a keen cricketing mind, you are one of the finest to have graced the field. Congratulations on a stellar career, and here’s to an even brighter future off the field!” Kumble posted on X.
India’s right-handed batter, KL Rahul, praised Ashwin for his skill, determination, and passion for the game. “Congratulations on a legendary career, Ash! Your skill, determination, and passion for the game have inspired us all. It’s been an honour to share the field and the dressing room with you. Wishing you all the best for what lies ahead. @ashwinravi99,” Rahul posted on X.
Veteran batter Cheteshwar Pujara reflected on the moments shared with Ashwin during their time in the national team. “Many congratulations on a career you can be very proud of, Ash! Your dedication and contribution to Indian cricket over a long period will be etched in history as one of the best to have represented the country! Over the years, we have shared countless memories on and off the field, and your decision today suddenly brings a lump in the throat and a flashback of some of the great times we have shared. While this chapter may have ended, I am sure you will continue to contribute to Indian cricket and the game at large. Wishing you and your family all the best for the future. As a teammate and friend, it has truly been an honour and a pleasure to have played with you!” Pujara wrote on X.
Karnataka opener Mayank Agarwal described Ashwin’s retirement as befitting a legend. “He came, he saw, he conquered, and he left like a legend! This is so your style to spin this sudden announcement, Ashley!! One of the best spinners I have had the privilege of sharing the dressing room with. Thank you for the magic, the memories, and the mastery. Continue to spin your all-round magic wherever you go,” Agarwal wrote on X.
Earlier, Ashwin appeared alongside India’s captain, Rohit Sharma, at the post-match press conference to announce his decision. Speculation about his retirement began to build when he became emotional and was hugged by Virat Kohli in the dressing room. 
Ashwin played 106 Tests, taking a staggering 537 wickets, including 37 five-wicket hauls, and scored 3,503 runs. His contributions to Indian cricket extend far beyond these impressive statistics. He is the seventh-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket history and the second-highest for India, behind Anil Kumble (619). He also has the second-most five-wicket hauls in Tests, after Sri Lankan legend Muttiah Muralitharan (67). 
Ashwin was instrumental in India’s dominance in Test cricket, particularly during their rise to the top from 2014 to 2019.
In limited-overs cricket, Ashwin played 181 matches and took 228 wickets. He featured in 116 ODIs, claiming 156 wickets with best figures of 4/25 and scoring 707 runs. In 65 T20Is, he took 72 wickets, with best figures of 4/8, and scored 184 runs. With 765 international wickets across formats, Ashwin is India’s second-highest wicket-taker, behind Kumble (953). 
Ashwin was also part of India’s 2011 World Cup-winning squad and the 2013 Champions Trophy team.

Title: Tom Cruise honored with US Navy’s highest civilian award
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:05:41 +0000
Content: Hollywood star Tom Cruise has received the US Navy’s highest civilian honor for his “outstanding contributions” to the military through his work on screen.
It was with the 1986 blockbuster Top Gun that Cruise shot to fame, with the film’s record-breaking success boosting military enlistment.
The Distinguished Public Service Award was presented to Cruise on Tuesday at the Longcross Film Studios in Chertsey, Surrey, reports BBC.com.
The 61-year-old star expressed his gratitude for the “extraordinary acknowledgment.” “I admire all of the servicemen and women,” Cruise said, standing beside US Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro, who handed him the certificate and medal.
Cruise emphasized his belief that “to lead is to serve,” adding, “I know this to my core, and I see that in the servicemen and women.”
The Navy credited Cruise with increasing public awareness and appreciation for the sacrifices made by its highly trained personnel. His role as pilot Maverick in Top Gun, a movie about Cold War flying aces, was so influential that the Navy even set up recruitment tables in theaters to capitalize on its popularity.
Cruise reprised his role as Lieutenant Pete Mitchell in the 2022 sequel Top Gun: Maverick, which the Navy said “reinvigorated” interest in the military among younger audiences.
On Tuesday, Del Toro added, “Tom Cruise has spent nearly four decades as an unwavering supporter of the men, women, and families of the Navy and Marine Corps.”
Cruise was also celebrated for his roles in other iconic films, including Born on the Fourth of July, A Few Good Men, and the Mission: Impossible series. He is currently in Chertsey, Surrey, working on his next film, Mission: Impossible: The Final Reckoning, set for release in May 2025.
The prestigious civilian honor has previously been awarded to luminaries such as Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks for their work on the World War II epic Saving Private Ryan.

Title: Russian foreign ministry says Ukraine repeatedly dropped white phosphorus from drones
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:01:04 +0000
Content: Russia said on Wednesday that Ukraine had repeatedly dropped white phosphorus munitions from drones in September, but Kyiv denied it had used such weapons and said it was Moscow which had used prohibited chemical substances on the battlefield.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said law enforcement agencies had evidence of the use of such munitions by Ukraine, but she did not provide details.
“The law enforcement agencies of our country, together with the Russian Defence Ministry, have received irrefutable evidence of the repeated use of white phosphorus ammunition dropped from drones by the armed forces of Ukraine in September,” Zakharova said.
Ukraine, which has accused Russia of using phosphorus in the war, said Zakharova’s statement was false and accused Russia of using prohibited chemical substances on the battlefield.
“The Russian accusations are false and nonsensical,” foreign ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi told Reuters in a written statement.
“Ukraine has always been and continues to be a reliable participant in multilateral regimes for the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and it faithfully complies with the international obligations stemming from their provisions.”

Title: Sensex, Nifty end lower ahead of US Fed rate decision
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 11:55:23 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices declined on Wednesday as cautious investor sentiment prevailed ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s policy decision later in the day.
The Sensex dropped 502.25 points, or 0.62 percent, to close at 80,182.20, while the Nifty fell 137.15 points, or 0.56 percent, to settle at 24,198.85.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), 1,447 shares ended in the green, while 2,558 declined, and 94 remained unchanged.
In the Sensex pack, the top gainers included TCS, Sun Pharma, Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech, M&M, ITC, and Infosys, while Tata Motors, Power Grid, NTPC, JSW Steel, ICICI Bank, L&T, Bajaj Finance, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and SBI were among the major laggards.
Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said that market sentiment remained subdued ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with investors wary of potential shifts in policy and tariffs under the incoming US administration. The US Federal Reserve, which had been maintaining steady interest rates, implemented a total of 75 basis points in rate cuts during its September and November reviews.
Nair pointed out that concerns over India’s high market valuation have contributed to investor caution. The valuation is seen as exceeding current earnings growth, which has decelerated over the past two quarters.
Additionally, India’s trade deficit for November, which reached a record USD 37.84 billion due to increased imports, further weighed on market sentiment.

Title: Leader of former Syrian opposition says transitional government should not exclude any party
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 11:51:48 +0000
Content: Hadi al-Bahra, head of the Syrian National Coalition that grouped opponents of Bashar al-Assad during the civil war, said on Wednesday Syria’s transitional government should be credible and not exclude any Syrian party or be based on sectarianism.
In a seismic moment for the Middle East, Syrian rebels seized control of Damascus on Dec. 8, forcing Assad to flee after more than 13 years of civil war, ending his family’s decades-long rule.
The lightning offensive raised questions over whether the rebels will be able to ensure an orderly transition.
Representatives of the Syrian National Coalition had not met Syrian rebel leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, but had communications with the caretaker government and parties close to him, al-Bahra said during a press conference in Istanbul.
Forces under the command of al-Sharaa – better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani – replaced the Assad family rule with a three-month transitional government that had been ruling a rebel enclave in Syria’s northwestern province of Idlib.
Al-Sharaa is the leader of the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which is designated a terrorist group by Western and regional powers.
Newly appointed Prime Minister Mohammed al-Bashir formerly led an HTS-affiliated government in Idlib.
The Syrian National Coalition would return to Syria and set up headquarters there, former Syrian opposition leader al-Bahra said, adding that he intended to return as well.
“Logistics should be worked out and freedom of speech should be guaranteed,” he added.

Content: The total number of mobile subscriptions in the country now stands at 115.12 crore (as on October 31), the Parliament was informed on Wednesday.
Out of 6,44,131 villages in the country, around 6,23,622 villages now have mobile coverage, Minister of State for Communications and Rural Development, Dr Chandra Sekhar Pemmasani, told the Lok Sabha in a written reply to a question.
Mobile coverage for inhabited uncovered villages is provided by the government and the telecom service providers (TSPs) in a phased manner, he added.
Further, the government is implementing various schemes and projects under Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN) for the expansion of telecom connectivity through the installation of mobile towers in rural, remote, and hilly areas of the country, said the minister.
In addition, the BharatNet project (earlier known as National Optical Fiber Network) being funded by Digital Bharat Nidhi is being implemented in a phased manner to provide broadband connectivity to all Gram Panchayats (GPs) in the country.
The amended BharatNet Programme was approved by Cabinet for the up-gradation of the existing network of BharatNet Phase-I and Phase-II, creation of a network in the remaining nearly 42,000 gram panchayats, operation and maintenance for 10 years and utilisation at the total cost of Rs 1,39,579 crore, said Dr Pemmasani.
Last week, the government informed that mobile network coverage in rural India has reached nearly 97 per cent and at least 6,14,564 villages are covered with 4G mobile connectivity.
In a reply to a question in Rajya Sabha, Dr Pemmasani said that under the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN) of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, 4,543 particularly vulnerable tribal group (PVTG) habitations were identified as mobile uncovered and out of these, 1,136 PVTG habitations have been covered with mobile connectivity.
In the meantime, 5G services are now available in 779 districts out of 783 districts in the country (as of October 31). Further, more than 4.6 lakh 5G Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) have been installed in the country, informed the minister.

Title: Many factors distort blood pressure readings: report
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 11:24:28 +0000
Content: Blood pressure readings are often distorted due to skipped steps in measurement, such as sitting posture, arm positioning, recent caffeine intake, or talking during the process. These factors can produce readings higher or lower than normal, highlighting the need for precise procedures to assess cardiovascular health accurately.
“To make meaningful improvements in cardiovascular health, we need to screen and treat hypertension correctly,” said Tammy Brady, a pediatric nephrologist at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Accurate blood pressure readings are critical for preventing heart attacks, strokes, and other life-threatening conditions. Guidelines from the American Heart Association recommend that patients sit with both feet on the ground, legs uncrossed, back straight, and arms supported on a surface. The cuff should be positioned over a bare arm at heart level, and distractions like talking or using a phone should be avoided.
The World Health Organisation reports that 1.28 billion adults worldwide have hypertension, with 46% unaware of their condition.
Last month, an international study led by the University of Sydney and University College London suggested that even five minutes of daily physical activity, such as walking uphill or stair climbing, could significantly reduce blood pressure. Researchers estimate that replacing 20-27 minutes of sedentary behavior with exercise can lead to clinically meaningful reductions in blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular disease incidence by 28%.

Title: France’s highest court upholds Sarkozy’s corruption conviction
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 14:11:12 +0000
Content: The Cour de Cassation, France’s highest court, upheld on Wednesday former President Nicolas Sarkozy’s conviction for corruption and influence peddling.
Sarkozy had appealed against the 2021 conviction for corruption and influence peddling, in which he had been handed a three-year prison sentence. Two of the years were suspended and Sarkozy would wear an electronic monitoring bracelet instead of going to prison for the last year.
Patrice Spinosi, lawyer for Sarkozy, said Sarkozy would appeal to the European Court for Human Rights to challenge the ruling.
Spinosi added Sarkozy would comply with the ruling which forces him to wear an electronic bracelet but would continue to use all legal means available to him to prove his innocence.
Sarkozy, a conservative who remains an important figure in French politics even after leaving office in 2012, had been found guilty by a lower court of trying to bribe a judge and of peddling influence in exchange for confidential information about a probe into his 2007 campaign finances.
The court found that Sarkozy conspired to secure a job in Monaco for a judge in exchange for inside information about an investigation into allegations that Sarkozy had accepted illegal payments from L’Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt.
The judge, Gilbert Azibert, was also convicted for corruption and influence peddling.
Sarkozy is expected to stand trial next year on corruption and illegal financing charges related to alleged Libyan funding of his successful 2007 presidential bid. Sarkozy denies all wrongdoing.
If convicted in the Libya case, Sarkozy could face up to 10 years in prison.
Sarkozy’s predecessor, Jacques Chirac, a fellow conservative, is the only other president in modern French history to be convicted by a court. Chirac was found guilty of corruption in 2011, four years after he left office.

The embassy, in a post on X, shared the update, saying, “India in Bahrain is pleased to announce repatriation of 28 Indian fishermen who were recently freed after reduction in sentence from 6 to 3 months. The embassy facilitated legal assistance and travel under GoI’s Indian Community Welfare Fund. Well-being of Indian nationals is our priority.”
The Indian Embassy also thanked the Bahraini authorities for “cooperation.” In another post on X, it wrote, “We thank the Bahraini authorities for cooperation & swift response including for providing consular access. Wishing them a safe return to their families in India.”
Earlier on September 26, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin urged External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to take immediate diplomatic initiatives to ensure consular access and legal assistance to secure an early release of 28 fishermen from the Idinthakarai fishing village of Tirunelveli district apprehended by the Bahrain Coast Guard on September 11.
In his letter, Stalin highlighted that the fishermen, employed in Iran, were apprehended by Bahrain’s Coast Guard on September 11 for allegedly crossing maritime borders. He noted that the boats they were operating belonged to Iranian nationals, and their arrest had severely impacted their families, who rely on their income.
“The families of the fishermen, who are highly dependent on their income, have been severely impacted by the arrest,” he said.
CM Stalin had also requested the EAM Jaishankar to take immediate diplomatic initiatives to ensure consular access and legal assistance to secure the early release of the arrested fishermen. (ANI)

Title: India reveals ambitious space station plans, accelerates private-sector role
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:10:47 +0000
Content: India is accelerating its space ambitions with the announcement of the Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS), a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space station designed to establish a sustained human presence in space. The station aims to support medium- to long-duration human spaceflight missions and enable advanced scientific research and technology development in microgravity.
Union Minister of State for Science and Technology Dr Jitendra Singh revealed on Wednesday that the first module of BAS, known as BAS-01, is scheduled for launch in 2028. The station is expected to become fully operational by 2035. This milestone is part of a broader expansion of the Gaganyaan programme, which now includes precursor missions to BAS, reflecting India’s growing capabilities in human spaceflight.
In addition to the BAS project, the central government has been actively fostering private-sector participation in the space sector to drive innovation and large-scale investment. The Indian government estimates that the nation’s space economy, currently valued at $8.4 billion and representing 2-3% of the global market, has the potential to reach $44 billion by 2033, with private-sector involvement playing a crucial role in achieving this growth.
The liberalised space policy now allows non-governmental entities to undertake comprehensive space activities. To facilitate this, the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) was established to promote, authorise, and oversee private-sector involvement.
The government has implemented a range of initiatives to encourage private-sector growth. These include the Indian Space Policy 2023, which offers regulatory certainty for stakeholders, and a ₹1,000 crore venture capital fund dedicated to supporting space start-ups. IN-SPACe has also introduced various support schemes, including seed funding, mentorship, and skill development programmes, as well as facilitating technology transfers for small satellite launch vehicles and Earth observation systems.
The impact of these efforts is evident in the growth of space start-ups in India, which have increased from just one in 2014 to 266 today. IN-SPACe has signed 71 agreements with private entities, enabling them to contribute to the development of launch vehicles and satellites. 
Additionally, initiatives such as public-private partnerships in Earth observation systems and revised FDI policies are further opening doors for foreign investment in the Indian space sector.
India’s Department of Space has also been advancing ground station capabilities. It has successfully developed a Tri-band Data Reception System that enables cost-effective tracking and data reception from remote sensing satellites. These capabilities have been leveraged to support 17 satellite and launch vehicle missions on a commercial basis.
The Department of Space has made Earth observation data widely accessible. Data with a spatial resolution of five metres is available for free, while higher-resolution data is offered at no cost to government entities and at fair prices to private players.
NSIL, ISRO’s commercial arm, has been providing tracking facilities and satellite data services to domestic and international clients as part of its “Ground Station as a Service” initiative. This reflects the increasing commercialisation of India’s space capabilities.
To streamline processes for private players, IN-SPACe is exploring the creation of a single-window interface for authorisations, approvals, and licences, aimed at reducing administrative hurdles for companies operating in the space sector.

Title: Cricket community lauds Ashwin after he calls time on his international career
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:08:34 +0000
Content: The cricketing fraternity took to social media to praise 38-year-old off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin after he announced his retirement from Test cricket, following the conclusion of the Brisbane Test at the Gabba on Wednesday.
Former India cricketer Dinesh Karthik, who shared the dressing room with Ashwin both internationally and domestically, commended him on his remarkable career. “A GOAT retires. Well done on what’s been an outstanding career. Proud to have played with you and definitely the greatest ever to have played from Tamil Nadu @ashwinravi99. Much love and enjoy some leisurely time with family and friends,” Karthik wrote on X.
West Indies legend Ian Bishop lauded Ashwin’s contributions during his illustrious 14-year international career. “Thank you, Ravi Ashwin. Glad you came, and that you were a part of the international game for so long, with such excellence. You taught, you educated, and you entertained,” Ian Bishop wrote on X.
Former India captain and leg-spinner, Anil Kumble, congratulated Ashwin on his “stellar” career. “@ashwinravi99 your journey has been nothing short of extraordinary! With over 700 international wickets and a keen cricketing mind, you are one of the finest to have graced the field. Congratulations on a stellar career, and here’s to an even brighter future off the field!” Kumble posted on X.
India’s right-handed batter, KL Rahul, praised Ashwin for his skill, determination, and passion for the game. “Congratulations on a legendary career, Ash! Your skill, determination, and passion for the game have inspired us all. It’s been an honour to share the field and the dressing room with you. Wishing you all the best for what lies ahead. @ashwinravi99,” Rahul posted on X.
Veteran batter Cheteshwar Pujara reflected on the moments shared with Ashwin during their time in the national team. “Many congratulations on a career you can be very proud of, Ash! Your dedication and contribution to Indian cricket over a long period will be etched in history as one of the best to have represented the country! Over the years, we have shared countless memories on and off the field, and your decision today suddenly brings a lump in the throat and a flashback of some of the great times we have shared. While this chapter may have ended, I am sure you will continue to contribute to Indian cricket and the game at large. Wishing you and your family all the best for the future. As a teammate and friend, it has truly been an honour and a pleasure to have played with you!” Pujara wrote on X.
Karnataka opener Mayank Agarwal described Ashwin’s retirement as befitting a legend. “He came, he saw, he conquered, and he left like a legend! This is so your style to spin this sudden announcement, Ashley!! One of the best spinners I have had the privilege of sharing the dressing room with. Thank you for the magic, the memories, and the mastery. Continue to spin your all-round magic wherever you go,” Agarwal wrote on X.
Earlier, Ashwin appeared alongside India’s captain, Rohit Sharma, at the post-match press conference to announce his decision. Speculation about his retirement began to build when he became emotional and was hugged by Virat Kohli in the dressing room. 
Ashwin played 106 Tests, taking a staggering 537 wickets, including 37 five-wicket hauls, and scored 3,503 runs. His contributions to Indian cricket extend far beyond these impressive statistics. He is the seventh-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket history and the second-highest for India, behind Anil Kumble (619). He also has the second-most five-wicket hauls in Tests, after Sri Lankan legend Muttiah Muralitharan (67). 
Ashwin was instrumental in India’s dominance in Test cricket, particularly during their rise to the top from 2014 to 2019.
In limited-overs cricket, Ashwin played 181 matches and took 228 wickets. He featured in 116 ODIs, claiming 156 wickets with best figures of 4/25 and scoring 707 runs. In 65 T20Is, he took 72 wickets, with best figures of 4/8, and scored 184 runs. With 765 international wickets across formats, Ashwin is India’s second-highest wicket-taker, behind Kumble (953). 
Ashwin was also part of India’s 2011 World Cup-winning squad and the 2013 Champions Trophy team.

Title: Tom Cruise honored with US Navy’s highest civilian award
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:05:41 +0000
Content: Hollywood star Tom Cruise has received the US Navy’s highest civilian honor for his “outstanding contributions” to the military through his work on screen.
It was with the 1986 blockbuster Top Gun that Cruise shot to fame, with the film’s record-breaking success boosting military enlistment.
The Distinguished Public Service Award was presented to Cruise on Tuesday at the Longcross Film Studios in Chertsey, Surrey, reports BBC.com.
The 61-year-old star expressed his gratitude for the “extraordinary acknowledgment.” “I admire all of the servicemen and women,” Cruise said, standing beside US Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro, who handed him the certificate and medal.
Cruise emphasized his belief that “to lead is to serve,” adding, “I know this to my core, and I see that in the servicemen and women.”
The Navy credited Cruise with increasing public awareness and appreciation for the sacrifices made by its highly trained personnel. His role as pilot Maverick in Top Gun, a movie about Cold War flying aces, was so influential that the Navy even set up recruitment tables in theaters to capitalize on its popularity.
Cruise reprised his role as Lieutenant Pete Mitchell in the 2022 sequel Top Gun: Maverick, which the Navy said “reinvigorated” interest in the military among younger audiences.
On Tuesday, Del Toro added, “Tom Cruise has spent nearly four decades as an unwavering supporter of the men, women, and families of the Navy and Marine Corps.”
Cruise was also celebrated for his roles in other iconic films, including Born on the Fourth of July, A Few Good Men, and the Mission: Impossible series. He is currently in Chertsey, Surrey, working on his next film, Mission: Impossible: The Final Reckoning, set for release in May 2025.
The prestigious civilian honor has previously been awarded to luminaries such as Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks for their work on the World War II epic Saving Private Ryan.

Title: Russian foreign ministry says Ukraine repeatedly dropped white phosphorus from drones
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:01:04 +0000
Content: Russia said on Wednesday that Ukraine had repeatedly dropped white phosphorus munitions from drones in September, but Kyiv denied it had used such weapons and said it was Moscow which had used prohibited chemical substances on the battlefield.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said law enforcement agencies had evidence of the use of such munitions by Ukraine, but she did not provide details.
“The law enforcement agencies of our country, together with the Russian Defence Ministry, have received irrefutable evidence of the repeated use of white phosphorus ammunition dropped from drones by the armed forces of Ukraine in September,” Zakharova said.
Ukraine, which has accused Russia of using phosphorus in the war, said Zakharova’s statement was false and accused Russia of using prohibited chemical substances on the battlefield.
“The Russian accusations are false and nonsensical,” foreign ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi told Reuters in a written statement.
“Ukraine has always been and continues to be a reliable participant in multilateral regimes for the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and it faithfully complies with the international obligations stemming from their provisions.”
