Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 13:00:20 +0000
Content: Leaders of the Mahayuti alliance were sworn in as cabinet ministers in the Maharashtra government during a ceremony at Raj Bhavan in Nagpur on Sunday.  
The Mahayuti alliance comprises the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and the Shiv Sena. 
BJP leaders, including state unit chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule, Ashish Shelar, Ganesh Naik, Mangal Prabhat Lodha, Pankaja Munde, Girish Mahajan, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, Chandrakant Patil, and Nitesh Rane, took the oath of office.  
Representing Shiv Sena’s Eknath Shinde faction, leaders such as Shambhuraj Desai, Dadaji Dagadu Bhuse, Sanjay Rathod, Uday Samant, Gulabrao Patil, and Sanjay Shirsat were also sworn in. Additionally, NCP leaders Aditi Tatkare, Dhananjay Munde, and Hasan Mushrif joined the Cabinet.  
Maharashtra Governor CP Radhakrishnan administered the oath to the newly inducted ministers, in the presence of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Deputy Chief Ministers Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar.  
This Cabinet expansion occurred over two weeks after CM Fadnavis and his two deputies were sworn in on December 5. The Mahayuti alliance, which commands a significant majority in the Assembly, had faced criticism from the opposition for delaying the Cabinet announcement.  
In the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly Election, the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance secured a landslide victory, winning 235 seats. The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 132 seats, while Shiv Sena and the NCP won 57 and 41 seats, respectively.

Title: Will end naxalism in Chhattisgarh by March 2026: Amit Shah
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 11:42:46 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday reiterated the government’s commitment to eradicating maoism in Chhattisgarh by March 31, 2026. He lauded the state police for their efforts in combating Left-wing extremism over the past year.  
Speaking at an event in Raipur to commemorate the President’s Colour Award being conferred on the Chhattisgarh Police, Shah urged maoists to join the mainstream and take advantage of the state government’s surrender policy.  
“I have worked closely with the Chhattisgarh Police on anti-Naxal operations and can confidently say that they are among the most courageous forces in the country, fighting Naxals and improving the lives of citizens,” he said.  
The home minister highlighted that in the past year, 287 extremists were neutralised, nearly 1,000 arrested, and 837 surrendered. He also noted that the top 14 Naxal leaders were eliminated during this period. For the first time in four decades, fatalities among troops and civilians have dropped below 100 in a single year.  
Shah credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership for a significant reduction in violence, stating that fatalities among security forces decreased by 73%, and civilian deaths dropped by 70% over the past decade compared to the previous one.  
He added that the motto of “Viksit Chhattisgarh, Viksit Bastar” would receive a renewed push from the state police, who achieved the rare distinction of receiving the President’s Colour Award before completing 25 years of service.  
Referring to the state’s political journey, Shah recalled that when Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee established Chhattisgarh in 2000, the BJP-led government served for 15 years. “Now, with Vishnu Deo Sai as Chief Minister, I assure you that we will free Chhattisgarh from Naxalism by March 31, 2026,” he declared.  
Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai congratulated the police force on the honour and highlighted initiatives by both the central and state governments to rehabilitate surrendered extremists. These include providing 15,000 houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, financial aid, land grants for agriculture, and reservations in educational institutions for surrendered extremists and their families.  
The chief minister also detailed welfare measures for victims of Maoist violence, including technical education reservations, skill development programs for women, and land allocation for housing and agriculture.

Title: South Korea to invest $1.9 billion in tech to tackle climate change
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 11:41:30 +0000
Content: The South Korean government plans to invest 2.7 trillion won ($1.9 billion) in developing technologies to combat climate change next year, the Ministry of Science and ICT announced on Sunday.  
This represents a 3.9 percent increase from the 2.6 trillion won allocated for the initiative in 2024, according to the ministry.  
The investment forms part of the government’s 10-year plan to advance scientific technologies by 2032 in response to global warming, Yonhap News Agency reported. South Korea has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent from 2018 levels by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.  
The 2025 budget will focus on developing core renewable energy technologies, such as next-generation solar batteries and large-scale floating wind power systems. It will also prioritize advancements in carbon-neutral technologies, including next-generation nuclear power systems and hydrogen power.  
The government aims to assess the vulnerability of forests, marine areas, and ecosystems to climate change while implementing measures to ensure stable food production.  
Meanwhile, the science ministry has completed a comprehensive roadmap for achieving carbon neutrality across various industries. The Presidential Special Committee on Carbon Neutrality Technologies has devised strategies for six key sectors: wind power, energy storage, the environment, and more.  
With these guidelines, South Korea now has a comprehensive plan to develop carbon reduction technologies in 17 areas, spanning industries such as steelmaking, chemicals, car manufacturing, and nuclear power. Specific initiatives include the development of next-generation offshore wind turbines, integrated energy systems, and eco-friendly data centers.

Title: Indian SCBs post record net profit of ₹23.50 lakh crore in FY24, reduce NPAs
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 11:17:57 +0000
Content: Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) in India have achieved a significant milestone by recording the highest-ever aggregate net profit of ₹23.50 lakh crore in FY2023-24, compared to ₹22.63 lakh crore in FY2022-23, according to the Ministry of Finance.  
The asset quality of SCBs has also improved remarkably, with the gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio declining to 2.67% (₹4.75 lakh crore) in June 2024 from a peak of 11.18% (₹10.36 lakh crore) in March 2018. Public Sector Banks (PSBs) reported a similar improvement, with their gross NPA ratio dropping to 3.32% in June 2024, compared to 14.58% in March 2018 and 4.97% in March 2015.  
Additionally, the provision coverage ratio (PCR) of SCBs has risen from 49.31% in March 2015 to a robust 92.52% in June 2024, reflecting increased resilience in the banking sector.  
The Reserve Bank of India’s recent stress test results indicate that SCBs remain well-capitalized and capable of withstanding macroeconomic shocks without requiring additional capital infusion. All banks are expected to meet the minimum regulatory Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 5.5%, even under severe stress scenarios.  
PSBs recorded their highest-ever net profit of ₹1.41 lakh crore in FY2023-24, up from ₹1.05 lakh crore in FY2022-23. In the first half of FY2024-25, PSBs achieved a net profit of ₹0.86 lakh crore, underscoring their strong financial performance.

Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 08:59:56 +0000
Content: Parliamentarians under the Rajya Sabha Chairman XI and Lok Sabha Speaker XI played a friendly cricket match at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium on Sunday.  
BJP MP Anurag Thakur captained the Lok Sabha Speaker XI, while Union Minister Kiren Rijiju led the Rajya Sabha Chairman XI. The friendly match was named the “TB Mukt Bharat Awareness Cricket Match.”  
 
Speaking to ANI, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju said, “Several of our MP colleagues have come here. With the mantra of fitness, this event was scheduled to energize people through sports. I believe everyone will play with enthusiasm. Our mantra is ‘TB-Free India’ and the ‘Fit India Movement.’”
 
“Without fitness, you cannot serve the country. You must be fit both mentally and physically,” he added.  
 
“PM Modi has set the goal of making India TB-free by 2025, while the global goal is 2030. Since 2015, there has been a 38% drop in TB-related deaths in India, and an 18% reduction in new cases. This number is around 8% globally. This means India is performing better than the rest of the world”,.BJP MP Anurag Thakur said while speaking to reporters.  
 
“Despite being the most populous country, there is treatment available. The government provides free medicines and financial support of Rs 1000 for the treatment. Cases are also tracked”.
 
AAP MP Raghav Chadha praised the initiative, saying, “This is a great initiative. The match is being played for a good cause. I believe the awareness of this cause will spread to every corner of the country through this match.”  
 
“Additionally, while elections end, the animosity in the political arena between leaders continues even after that. I think that through such teamwork initiatives, animosity will be diminished, and we will work as a team for Bharat Mata to take the country forward,” Chadha said while speaking to ANI.  
 
BJP MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy felt that the MPs’ effort towards a TB-free India was unique.  
 
“This is a unique effort by MPs towards a TB-free India. The captain of our team is Anurag Thakur, who had been the Sports Minister. This is another side of MPs. Cricket is the most popular sport in the world,” he said.  
 
BJP MP Manoj Tiwari said that through this friendly match, they aim to raise awareness about TB and told reporters, “We want to give a message that we, as MPs, will still run on the field, play this match, and try to create awareness about TB. TB can be defeated with a little awareness. Who wins today’s match is a different matter, but we must defeat TB and make the country win.”  
 
Union Minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu expressed his happiness, saying, “I am very happy to participate, especially with all the MPs today. I would like to congratulate the organizers for putting together a great event. The PM has committed to defeating TB by 2025, and a series of events have been organized based on this. Today, we are taking another step forward to create more awareness in the country and unite everyone in the fight against TB.”  
 
Former India captain and Congress leader Mohammad Azharuddin remarked, “It is a joy to meet everyone like this and for MPs to get an outing like this. The country should indeed be TB-free. It should be eradicated as soon as possible. I am happy to be participating today.”  
 
BJP MP Ravi Kishan gave his take on the “historic match” while speaking to ANI, saying, “This will be a historic match. The youth must be awakened and freed from drugs and TB. We will fulfill PM Modi’s dreams when we create awareness about TB among our children.”  
 
The government’s commitment to “End TB by 2025” was first articulated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the “End TB Summit” held in New Delhi in March 2018 and was reaffirmed at the “One World TB Summit” in Varanasi on World TB Day 2023, as per an official release.
 
At this summit, the Prime Minister emphasized the need for a decisive and revitalized response to TB.

Title: PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana surpasses 6.85 lakh installations
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 08:12:21 +0000
Content: The PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana scheme has recorded over 6.85 lakh installations to date and is on track to surpass a decade’s worth of solar growth in just one year.
Launched in February this year, the scheme has already reached 86 percent of the total installations made in the previous decade, with 685,763 installations so far.
The demand was particularly high for the 3-5 kW load segment, which accounted for 77 percent of installations, while 14 percent of the installations were in the higher-than-5 kW segment. Gujarat recorded the highest number of installations, followed by Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Kerala.
Gujarat saw the maximum number of solar installations under the initiative, with 2,86,545 installations. Maharashtra followed with 1,26,344 installations, while Uttar Pradesh recorded 53,423 installations.
As of now, around 1.45 crore registrations have been completed under the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, as reported in Parliament. The scheme aims to provide solar power to one crore households by March 2027.
Launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the scheme aims to achieve one crore rooftop solar installations in the residential sector by fiscal year 2027, with a budget allocation of Rs 75,021 crore.
States like Tripura, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, and Manipur have also seen an increase in installations.
To promote the PM Solar Scheme at the grassroots level, Urban Local Bodies and Panchayats have been incentivized to encourage rooftop solar systems in their jurisdictions. The scheme is also contributing to increased income, reduced power bills, and job creation.
With the goal of benefiting one crore households, the program is expected to save the government Rs 75,000 crore annually in electricity costs.
The scheme offers a subsidy of up to 40 percent to households, making renewable energy more affordable and accessible.
The government is partnering with all stakeholders, including REC, DISCOMs, and vendors, to address any challenges and ensure the successful implementation of the scheme.

Title: Cold wave sweeps northern Odisha; Ramatirtha in Mayurbhanj records lowest temperature at -10°C
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 08:03:02 +0000
Content: A severe cold wave gripped northern Odisha on Sunday, with the Mayurbhanj district experiencing the worst of the intense chill. The Ramatirtha area in the district recorded temperatures as low as -10 degrees Celsius. 
According to the Forest Department, other areas in Mayurbhanj also reported extremely low temperatures: Gurguria and Barehipani recorded 6 degrees Celsius, Chahala 4 degrees Celsius, Nawana -5 degrees Celsius, and Upper Baraha Kamuda (UBK) -3 degrees Celsius.
On Saturday, IMD scientist Dr. Soma Sen Roy stated that the cold wave in north and central India is expected to last for one to two days, with temperatures likely to rise by December 16-17. “North-westerly winds are currently blowing, and south-easterly winds will soon follow in North India. There is a possibility of a 1-2 degree Celsius drop in temperature in Delhi. Cold wave conditions have been recorded in Punjab and Madhya Pradesh and will persist for the next one to two days,” she said.
The Meteorological Department has forecast cold wave conditions in isolated pockets of Jammu-Kashmir-Ladakh-Gilgit-Baltistan-Muzaffarabad during December 14-16, Punjab on December 15, Haryana, Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gangetic West Bengal, and Odisha on December 14-15, West Rajasthan during December 17-20, East Rajasthan during December 14-20, and Madhya Pradesh on December 16.
In Srinagar, the maximum temperature was 9 degrees Celsius, while the minimum dropped to -5 degrees Celsius, according to the IMD.
Winter has also tightened its grip on the hill town of Shimla and its surrounding regions following a fresh spell of snowfall. The icy conditions have disrupted daily life for residents, causing significant challenges.
In Delhi, a thin layer of fog covered parts of the national capital as the minimum temperature dropped to 7 degrees Celsius, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). With temperatures dipping, many sought refuge in shelter homes.
Ved Pal, who manages a shelter near AIIMS Delhi, said that food and adequate bedding are provided to those seeking shelter. “This is a family shelter where we provide proper beds and as many blankets as they need. They are also given food twice a day, along with tea and rusk in the morning,” he told ANI.
Pal added that medical facilities are also available at the shelter. “We have a first aid box, and medicines are distributed based on a doctor’s recommendations. For more serious cases, we assist residents in getting to a hospital. General medicines like paracetamol are also stocked,” he said.

Title: One Nation, One Election Bill will not be tabled in Lok Sabha on Monday
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 07:31:08 +0000
Content: The ‘One Nation, One Election’ Bill, officially titled the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2024, will not be tabled in the Lok Sabha on Monday. The revised business list for the day does not include the Bill.
The initial schedule had listed the Bill for Monday, stating: “… Arjun Ram Meghwal to move for leave to introduce a Bill further to amend the Constitution of India. Also to introduce the Bill.”
The minister was also slated to introduce The Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, which seeks to amend the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963, the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991, and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019.
The first amendment Bill proposed simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies, while the second focused on aligning assembly elections in Delhi, Jammu & Kashmir, and Puducherry.
However, with the revised list omitting these Bills, it is now speculated that the One Nation, One Election Bill will not be tabled on Monday. The winter session is scheduled to conclude on December 20, and sources suggest the Bills might be introduced later this week or through a last-minute Supplementary List of Business with the Speaker’s approval.
On Thursday, the Union Cabinet had approved the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2024, and the Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024. Both Bills were circulated to MPs on Friday evening.
The proposals are based on recommendations by a high-level committee chaired by former President Ram Nath Kovind. The committee submitted its findings in March, highlighting the challenges posed by prolonged election cycles.
The 18,626-page report, prepared over 191 days, emphasized that simultaneous elections could ensure policy stability, reduce voter fatigue, and increase electoral participation.
Following the Cabinet’s approval, several opposition leaders criticized the proposal, labeling it impractical and a threat to federalism. They raised concerns over the government’s plan to table the Bill in the ongoing winter session.
The revised business list includes The Readjustment of Representation of Scheduled Tribes in Assembly Constituencies of the State of Goa Bill, 2024. This Bill seeks to ensure the reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in Goa’s Legislative Assembly, as per Article 332 of the Constitution, and to adjust seats in light of recent changes to the Scheduled Tribes list for the state.

Title: Ukraine to set up mechanism to supply food to Syria, Zelenskiy says
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 07:30:45 +0000
Content: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday he had instructed his government to set up supply mechanisms to deliver together with international organisations and partners food to Syria in the aftermath of the fall of President Bashar al-Assad.
Ukraine has been one of the world’s top grain and oilseeds exporters, and has been exporting wheat and corn to Middle Eastern countries, but not to Syria.
Syria imported food from Russia during the Assad era, but Russian wheat supplies have been suspended amid the uncertainty and payment delays, Russian and Syrian sources said on Friday.
“We are ready to assist Syria in preventing a food crisis, particularly through the humanitarian program ‘Grain from Ukraine’,” Zelenskiy wrote on X.
“I have instructed the government to establish food supply mechanisms in cooperation with international organizations and partners who can help.”
Ukraine’s exports were buffeted by Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, which severely reduced shipments via the Black Sea. Ukraine has since broken a de facto sea blockade and revived exports from its southern ports of Odesa.

Title: Brisbane Test: Smith joins century party with Head as Australia dominate day two
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 05:44:38 +0000
Content: Steve Smith clambered out of his form slump with a drought-breaking century and Travis Head smashed another big ton as Australia posted a commanding 405 for seven on day two of the third test against India in Brisbane on Sunday.
Smith batted away questions about his place in the team with a hard-earned 101 while Head marched on to a swashbuckling 152 to the delight of most of the 34,227-strong crowd at the Gabba.
“It was nice to get in, feel good,” said Smith, who scored his 33rd test ton and first since Lord’s at the 2023 Ashes.
“I missed out for a little while now so it’s nice to get three figures again.”
It took Jasprit Bumrah to salvage something from a tough day for India, the pace spearhead taking three wickets after tea to finish the day with his 12th five-wicket haul.
Seizing the new ball, he had Smith edge to Rohit in the slips to break a 241-partnership with Head before removing all-rounder Mitchell Marsh (five) and Head in quick succession.
 
But Bumrah’s bravery also amplified India’s heavy reliance on their star quick.
 
Recalled pacer Akash Deep and spinner Ravindra Jadeja were wicketless while seamer Mohammed Siraj spent time off-field after clutching at his hamstring when bowling in the morning.
 
Alex Carey was unbeaten on 45 and Mitchell Starc was on seven at stumps, having pushed Australia past 400.
 
CHALLENGING WICKET
 
The day belonged to Head and Smith, the former backing up his match-winning 140 in the pink ball test in Adelaide and the latter posting his 10th ton against India.
Hitting Deep for a single off his pads, Smith ended his longest streak without a hundred, bringing the Gabba crowd to their feet. The 35-year-old threw an icy stare at the Australian team and kissed the crest on his helmet.
Head hurtled to three figures, hitting a Bumrah full toss for three in the final minutes before tea to bring up his ninth test ton, then flying past 150 at nearly a run a ball.
“Nice to come out and start again, build a nice partnership and be able to contribute to the day,” said Head.

Title: South Korea court begins review of Yoon impeachment over martial law attempt
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 07:25:18 +0000
Content: South Korea’s Constitutional Court on Monday began reviewing the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol over his Dec. 3 martial law attempt, starting a process to decide if he will be removed from office, while investigators plan to question him this week.
The court will hold the first public hearing on Dec. 27, spokesperson Lee Jean told a news conference, after the court’s six justices met to discuss plans for reviewing the impeachment by the opposition-controlled parliament on Saturday.
The court has up to six months to decide whether to remove Yoon from office or to reinstate him. The first hearing will be “preparatory” to confirm major legal issues of the case and schedule among other matters, Lee said.
Yoon is not required to attend that hearing, he said.
In 2017, the court took three months to issue a ruling to strip then-President Park Geun-hye’s presidency following her impeachment for abusing the powers of her office.
Yoon and a number of senior officials face potential charges of insurrection, for the short-lived martial law.
A joint team of investigators from the police, the defence ministry and an anti-corruption agency are planning to call Yoon in for questioning at 10 a.m. (0100 GMT) on Wednesday, a police official told Reuters.
Investigators tried to serve a summon for Yoon to appear by delivering it to the presidential office and his official residence, but the presidential security service declined to receive it saying it was not in the position to do so, Yonhap news said.
On Sunday Yoon did not appear in response to a summons for questioning by a separate investigation by the prosecutors’ office, Yonhap news reported. Yoon cited he was still forming a legal team for his defence as the reason, it said.
The government led by acting president, Han Duck-soo, was moving quickly to reassure international partners and calm financial markets, while the main opposition party pledged to cooperate in efforts to stabilize the situation.
Early on Monday, the finance minister, Bank of Korea governor and top financial regulators met and pledged around-the-clock monitoring of financial and foreign exchange markets.
The benchmark KOSPI index .KS11 rose for a fifth straight session on Monday and traded at its highest levels in more than two weeks, as authorities vowed to stabilize financial markets and analysts noted eased political uncertainty.
Yoon’s surprise martial law declaration and the ensuing political crisis spooked markets and South Korea’s diplomatic partners, worried over the country’s ability to deter nuclear-armed North Korea.
In one of his first moves as acting president, Han spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden by telephone on Sunday, pledging unwavering commitment to pursue foreign and security policies based on the alliance between the two countries.
Opposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung welcomed U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of his former intelligence chief to handle special missions including North Korea as a sign of commitment for dialogue to ease tensions.
Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul said the nomination of Richard Grenell indicated North Korea will be one of the top priorities of Trump’s presidency. Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on three occasions during his first term.
The Saturday impeachment vote passed with at least 12 members of Yoon’s ruling People Power Party joining in favour, which has thrown the party into a disarray with its leader Han Dong-hoon announcing his resignation on Monday.

Title: PM Modi calls for collaborative governance and innovation at 4th National Conference of Chief Secretaries
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 06:48:35 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the 4th National Conference of Chief Secretaries on Sunday, highlighting the importance of collaborative governance for realizing the vision of Viksit Bharat. The three-day conference, which took place from December 13 to 15, brought together officials from all states and Union Territories, along with experts and senior officers from the central government.
In his speech, Prime Minister Modi emphasized that the greatest benefit of the conference was the opportunity for “Team India” to engage in open dialogue and work together toward the common goal of a developed nation. He underlined that Pro-People Pro-active Good Governance (P2G2) is at the heart of the country’s efforts to achieve the vision of Viksit Bharat.
The conference, centered around the theme of ‘Promoting Entrepreneurship, Employment, and Skilling – Leveraging the Demographic Dividend,’ saw extensive discussions on how to unlock India’s potential by harnessing its demographic advantages. PM Modi praised the rise of start-ups, particularly in smaller Tier 2 and 3 cities, and encouraged states to create an environment conducive to innovation. He urged state governments to identify areas that can support entrepreneurs and take measures to connect them with financial institutions and essential logistics infrastructure.
The Prime Minister also called for the simplification of bureaucratic processes, which he said often lead to the harassment of citizens. He stressed the importance of reforming governance models to promote citizen participation, urging that states focus on reform, perform, and transform while also ensuring that citizens are well-informed about government initiatives.
On the topic of sustainability, Prime Minister Modi highlighted the success of the GOBARdhan programme, which has emerged as a key energy resource by turning waste into wealth. He urged states to explore funding opportunities for the recycling of e-waste, which is expected to rise in the future as India becomes more digitally advanced. By doing so, India can reduce its reliance on imported materials and promote a circular economy.
In the health sector, PM Modi called for greater attention to addressing obesity as part of the Fit India Movement, noting that only a fit and healthy population can contribute to building a Viksit Bharat. He also expressed confidence that India could eliminate tuberculosis by the end of 2025 and emphasized the important role that ASHA and Anganwadi workers would play in achieving this goal.
The Prime Minister also spoke about the need to digitize India’s ancient manuscripts, calling them a treasure that should be preserved through technology. He further emphasized the importance of continuously updating the PM GatiShakti platform to include indicators related to environmental impacts and disaster-prone areas, ensuring that India’s infrastructure growth remains sustainable.
PM Modi also lauded the Aspirational Districts and Blocks Programme, stressing that the right officers posted in these areas could bring about significant socio-economic changes. He called for focused human resources development to transform cities into hubs of economic growth, underscoring the importance of urban governance, water management, and adequate housing to support the increasing urban mobility.
Paying tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his death anniversary, PM Modi hailed Patel as an inspiration for civil servants and urged them to work towards realizing his vision for a united and strong India. He also encouraged citizens to draw inspiration from the freedom movement and work towards making India a Viksit Bharat by 2047, just as they came together for independence.
The conference sessions delved into several key themes, including manufacturing, services, renewable energy, and circular economy, with a strong emphasis on women-led development as a driving force for economic transformation. Experts discussed a multifaceted approach to harnessing the potential of India’s service sector, particularly in smaller cities, and promoted rural entrepreneurship through targeted skilling programs.
A key focus of the discussions was the PRAGATI platform, designed to accelerate infrastructure development through rigorous monitoring and reviews. A special session on Frontier Technologies examined how technological convergence could provide solutions to global challenges while positioning India as a leader in inclusive and sustainable growth. Another special session, Karmayogi, focused on capacity building for civil servants, highlighting the importance of democratizing learning and strengthening citizen-centric programs.

Title: Bangladesh elections likely between late 2025 or early 2026: Dr Yunus
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 06:14:54 +0000
Content: The head of Interim Government of Bangladesh Dr Muhammad Yunus today said the next general election can be held in between the end of 2025 and the first half of 2026 after accomplishing necessary reforms.
“Broadly speaking, the election date can be set between the end of 2025 and the first half of 2026,” he said while addressing the nation this morning, marking the Victory Day. Bangladesh Television and BTV World broadcast the address of Dr Yunus.
Yunus emphasised that the timeline for the elections depends on the recommendations of the Electoral Reform Commission and the Constitution Reform Commission, which are currently conducting evaluations.
Morevere, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), one of the major political parties of Bangladesh, has been creating pressure for the last three months on Yunus led interim government for the Election roadmap. BNP’s acting chairperson Tarique Rahman said on Sunday that people had the right to know how many more months would be needed for the interim government to reform the state. He said that if the advisers’ faces turned gloomy when asked about the election roadmap, it certainly was a sign of going against the people’s aspirations.
Earlier, BangladeshPresident Mohammed Shahabuddin today paid rich tributes to the martyrs of the 1971 Liberation War by placing a wreath at the National Memorial here, on the outskirts of Dhaka, marking the 54th Victory Day as the country was liberated from the Pakistani occupation forces.
Dr Muhammad Yunus and President of Timor-Leste Jose Ramos-Horta, who is on a state visit to Bangladesh today paid rich tributes to the martyrs by placing wreaths at the National Memorial.
The High Commission of India in Bangladesh also extended its greetings to the people of Bangladesh. It said that the Vijay Diwas symbolises the strong bonds of friendship between India and Bangladesh which is made eternal by the shared sacrifices of Muktijoddhas and Indian soldiers who shed their blood to liberate Bangladesh from oppression and atrocities.
On this day in 1971, the Pakistani armed forces led by General A A K Niazi had surrendered before the Indian army and the Mukti-Bahini liberation force of Bangladesh with over 90,000 of his troops.

Title: Bangladesh celebrates Victory Day, commemorating liberation from Pakistani in 1971
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 06:01:00 +0000
Content: Bangladesh is set to celebrate the Victory Day today, the most precious day of the Bangladeshis, on December 16 as the country was liberated from the Pakistani occupation forces on that day in 1971 after a nine-month-long bloodstained War of Liberation. The nation would take a renewed pledge to translate into reality the hopes and aspirations of the War of Liberation and the dreams of the martyrs who made supreme sacrifices to liberate their beloved motherland from the Pakistani occupation forces in 1971.
Tens of thousands of people belonging to different social groups and political, cultural, professional and academic organizations and institutions are expected to throng the National Monument at Savar, near Dhaka, to pay homage to the heroes who embraced martyrdom to liberate the nation.
President Muhammad Sahabuddin is to be the first to offer wreaths at the monument amid a ceremonial honour guard while Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus is to follow him.
Political parties, socio-cultural and professional organizations and academic institutions are expected to follow them to place wreaths at the memorial.
A 31-gun salute will herald the Victory Day celebrations recalling the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent nation on the world map with the surrender of Pakistani forces.
To commemorate the Liberation War of 1971, India and Bangladesh invite each other’s War Veterans and serving officers to participate annually in each other’s Victory Day celebrations, said the High Commission of India in Bangladesh through an official facebook post.
On the 53th anniversary of the Liberation War, eight valiant Muktijoddhas and two serving officers of Bangladesh Armed Forces departed for India on Sunday to participate in Vijay Diwas celebrations at Kolkata. Similarly, eight Indian War Veterans and two serving officers of Indian Armed Forces reached Dhaka to participate in Bangladesh’s Victory Day celebrations, said the High Commission.
These bilateral visits provide a platform for Bangladesh Muktijoddhas and Indian War Veterans to celebrate the unique friendship of the two countries and to renew memories of the Liberation War. This memory epitomises the shared sacrifices of the armed forces of India and Bangladesh for the cause of Bangladesh’s freedom from occupation, oppression and mass atrocities, said the High Commission.
On this day in 1971, the Pakistani armed forces led by General A A K Niazi had surrendered before the Indian army and the Mukti-Bahini liberation force of Bangladesh with over 90,000 of his troops.

Title: China’s fragile recovery: industrial gains, sluggish retail, and stimulus pressure as U.S. tariffs loom
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 06:00:03 +0000
Content: China’s industrial output growth quickened slightly in November, while retail sales disappointed, keeping pressure on Beijing to ramp up stimulus for a fragile economy as it braces for more U.S. trade tariffs under a second Trump administration.
The mixed set of data underlines the challenges facing Chinese leaders heading into 2025 when trade relations with the United States could worsen at a time when domestic consumption also remains weak.
“China’s economy appears to have slowed last month, despite tailwinds from recent policy easing,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics.
“But we doubt that stimulus can deliver anything more than a short-lived improvement, not least because the current strength of export demand is unlikely to last once President Trump starts to put some of his tariff threats into action.”
China’s industrial output grew 5.4% in November year-on-year, up from the 5.3% pace seen in October, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Monday, beating expectations for a 5.3% increase in a Reuters poll.
However, retail sales, a gauge of consumption, grew just 3.3% last month, much slower than a 4.8% rise seen in October. Analysts had predicted a 4.6% expansion.
The weaker retail figures come despite a boost from major online shopping promotions and government-subsidised trade-in programs that have boosted sales in sectors including automobiles.
Fixed asset investment also increased at a slower 3.3% pace in January-November from the same period a year earlier, compared with an expected 3.4% rise. It grew 3.4% in the January to October period.
NBS spokesperson Fu Linghui told a media briefing that the trend of recovery in consumption has not changed and that more efforts would be needed to ensure the economic recovery continues into 2025.
At last week’s Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC), a closely-watched agenda-setting meeting, China’s top leaders pledged to raise the budget deficit, issue more debt, and make boosting consumption a top priority.
The remarks echoed commitments made by a meeting of top Communist Party officials, the Politburo, earlier this month, which endorsed an “appropriately loose” monetary policy in the first easing of its stance in 14 years.
Policymakers continue to grapple with a years-long property crisis that is dragging on consumer confidence and the broader economy, with some 70% of household savings parked in real estate.
There was some encouraging signs on China’s new home prices, which fell at the slowest pace in 17 months in November.
Officials in recent months have doubled down on efforts to encourage homebuying, including cutting mortgage rates and minimum down-payment ratios, as well as tax incentives to lower the cost of housing transactions.
However, most analysts say a sure-footed recovery in the real estate sector appears to be some way off.
Reuters has reported that policy advisers have recommended that Beijing maintain a growth target of around 5.0% for next year, with one government economist saying that China can offset the impact of expected U.S. tariffs on its exports by further boosting domestic demand.
Trump, who is set to start his second term as the U.S. president in January, has threatened tariffs in excess of 60% on imports of Chinese goods.
Reuters also reported last week that China was considering allowing the yuan to weaken in response to punitive trade measures, but a readout from state media Xinhua after the CEWC reiterated a commitment to maintain the yuan’s basic stability.
A recent Reuters poll predicted China will grow 4.5% next year, with new U.S. tariffs potentially shaving up to 1 parentage point off growth.

Title: Indian share market opens lower, auto and IT stocks drag
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 05:45:05 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market opened in the red on Monday, with selling pressure observed in Nifty’s auto, IT, PSU bank, pharma, and metal sectors.
At around 9:32 am, the Sensex was trading at 81,876.95, down by 256.17 points or 0.31%, while the Nifty was at 24,705.60, declining by 62.70 points or 0.25%.
Despite the decline, the market trend remained broadly positive. On the National Stock Exchange (NSE), 1,170 stocks were trading in the green, while 571 stocks were in the red.
Akshay Chinchalkar of Axis Securities commented on Friday’s highly volatile session, stating that the Nifty slumped during the early part of the session, “but the day’s low occurred exactly at the falling neckline of the bullish head-and-shoulders pattern, which was activated on December 3 with an upside objective of 25,500.”
He added, “This objective remains valid as long as the market stays above 23,873, but more critical support now is Friday’s low of 24,180.”
Nifty Bank was down 168 points or 0.31%, trading at 53,415.80. The Nifty Midcap 100 index rose by 243.30 points or 0.41%, trading at 59,234.85, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 index was up 108.10 points or 0.56%, at 19,515.40.
According to market experts, the heightened volatility in the market can be attributed to large positions in the F&O (Futures & Options) segments. The 500-point move in the Nifty from the day’s trough to its peak suggests massive short-covering activity.
In the Sensex pack, NTPC, JSW Steel, M&M, Titan, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Infosys, TCS, Hindustan Unilever Limited, Axis Bank, and Tech Mahindra were among the top losers. On the other hand, Tata Steel, UltraTech Cement, L&T, ITC, Tata Motors, IndusInd Bank, and HCL Tech emerged as the top gainers.
In Asian markets, except for China, indices in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Seoul, Jakarta, and Japan were trading in the red.
Meanwhile, in the US stock markets, the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.12% higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.20% lower in the previous trading session.
Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) bought equities worth Rs 2,335.32 crore on December 13, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) sold equities worth Rs 732.20 crore on the same day.

Title: Israel approves $11.13 million settlement expansion in Golan Heights
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 05:39:35 +0000
Content: The Israeli government has unanimously approved a comprehensive plan to expand settlements in the occupied Golan Heights, allocating more than $11.13 million to the initiative. The decision, announced Sunday, comes amid heightened regional tensions following recent political upheaval in Syria.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who proposed the plan, cited security concerns along Israel’s border with Syria as justification, pointing to what he called a “new front” following the fall of the Assad regime this month. The expansion initiative includes funding for education, renewable energy projects, a student village, and organizational development support for the Golan Regional Council to accommodate an influx of new residents.
Currently, the occupied Syrian Golan Heights has a population of approximately 50,000, evenly split between Israeli settlers and a mix of Druze, Alawite, and other communities. The new plan aims to significantly increase the Israeli settler presence in the region.
The announcement has triggered swift condemnation from multiple Arab nations. The United Arab Emirates denounced the decision through its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reaffirming its commitment to Syria’s territorial integrity and warning of potential regional escalation. Qatar characterized the move as “a new chapter in a series of Israeli attacks on Syrian territories,” urging international intervention to halt the expansion. Saudi Arabia added its voice to the growing opposition, explicitly condemning the settlement plan.
The Golan Heights, captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War and annexed in 1981, remains classified as occupied territory under international law. The United States stands alone in recognizing Israel’s annexation of the region, with the international community broadly rejecting Israeli sovereignty over the area.

Title: Israeli forces carry out air, ground attacks in Gaza; dozens dead
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 05:26:59 +0000
Content: Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 53 Palestinians, including a journalist and rescue workers, medics said, and the Israeli military said its air and ground forces in the north of the enclave killed dozens of militants and captured others.
An airstrike hit the civil emergency centre in the Nuseirat market area in the central Gaza Strip, killing Ahmed Al-Louh, a video journalist for Al Jazeera TV, and five other people, medics and fellow journalists said. Another strike on a house in Nuseirat camp killed five people, including children, according to medics.
The TV network said Al-Louh was working when he was killed and condemned Israel.
The Israeli military said the strike had targeted Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants operating from Gaza’s Civil Defence’s Nuseirat office. It named Al-Louh as a member of the militant group Islamic Jihad, without providing evidence.
Al Jazeera did not immediately comment on the Israeli allegation but has condemned previous claims by Israel naming some of the Qatari-owned network’s journalists killed in the Gaza war as members of militant groups.
Hamas media said the head of the civil emergency service in Nuseirat, Nedal Abu Hjayyer, was also killed.
“The civil emergency headquarters in Nuseirat camp was hit during the crews’ presence, they work around the clock to serve the people,” said Zaki Emadeldeen from the civil emergency service to reporters at the hospital.
Another airstrike hit a group of Hamas-linked men tasked with protecting aid trucks west of Gaza City, and medics said several were hurt but exact figures were unavailable.
At least 11 people were killed in three Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City houses, nine were killed in the towns of Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia camp when clusters of houses were bombed or set ablaze, and two were killed in Rafah, medics and residents said.
The Israeli military said the three Gaza City houses belonged to militants planning imminent attacks. It said steps were taken to reduce risk to civilians, including the use of precise munitions and aerial surveillance.
The military issued a photo showing the weapons it seized in Beit Lahiya that included explosives and dozens of grenades.
In southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, medics said that at least 20 people, including women and children, were killed when an airstrike hit a shelter housing displaced families.
In Beit Hanoun, residents said Israeli forces besieged families sheltering in Khalil Aweida school before storming it and ordering them to head towards Gaza City.
Medics said several people were killed and wounded during the raid while the army detained many men.
The military said it struck dozens of militants from the air and on the ground and captured others in Beit Hanoun.
Reuters was unable to confirm whether any of the people killed were fighters. Hamas does not disclose its casualties, and the Palestinian health ministry does not distinguish in its death toll between combatants and non-combatants.
Israel says Gaza’s militants regularly embed among civilians, using them as human shields. Hamas denies this.
HOSTAGES
Separately, Israel said aircraft struck a command and control centre in a compound in the Abu Shabak clinic in northern Gaza used by Hamas to store weapons and plan attacks. The Gaza health ministry said the medical center was destroyed.
Palestinians accuse Israel of carrying out ethnic cleansing to depopulate Gaza’s northern edge to create a buffer zone. Israel denies this and says the campaign targets Hamas militants. The military says it has instructed civilians to evacuate battle zones for their own safety.
The war began when the Palestinian militant group Hamas stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel then launched an air and land offensive that has killed almost 45,000 people, mostly civilians, according to authorities in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. The campaign has displaced nearly the entire population and left much of the enclave in ruins.
A bid by Egypt, Qatar and the United States to reach a truce, which would also include a hostage deal, has gained momentum in recent weeks, yet there has been no news of a breakthrough.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had spoken with U.S. President-elect Trump, who returns to the White House on Jan. 20, about efforts to secure a hostage release.
“We discussed the need to complete Israel’s victory and we spoke at length about the efforts we are making to free our hostages,” Netanyahu said in a statement on Sunday.

Title: Rajya Sabha to hold discussion on Constitution from today
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 05:16:26 +0000
Content: After a fiery debate over the Constitution in the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha is set to discuss the topic on Monday and Tuesday.
As per the list of business of the Upper House, there will be a “discussion on the glorious journey of the 75 years of the Constitution of India”.
Before the discussion begins, an obituary reference will be made on the passing away of ex-Member Shreegopal Vyas, papers will be laid on the table by eight ministers, and various Standing Committees will also submit their reports.
The debate in the Rajya Sabha comes amid escalating tensions over a no-confidence motion filed by the Congress-led opposition against Vice President and House Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar.
Last week, the Upper House saw uproar and adjournments over the no-trust motion against Dhankhar. The opposition’s motion accuses him of biased conduct.
The Rajya Sabha debate on the Constitution comes after a two-day discussion in the Lok Sabha. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh initiated the two-day debate with a focus on its historical significance and role in shaping the nation’s governance and global standing.
Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in her maiden speech in Parliament, said the BJP would have changed the Constitution had it not been for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi made references to Veer Savarkar which were objected to by the BJP members.
The highlight of the two-day discussion in the Lower House was Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech. He said the Constitutional amendments brought by his government weren’t done to tighten grip on power, in contrast with the Congress. He said the Nehru-Gandhi family had made a habit of amending the Constitution as it suited their interests, starting with the country’s first PM Jawaharlal Nehru.
PM Modi also outlined 11 resolutions for the country’s future. He said, “After being inspired by the inherent spirit of the Constitution, I want to present 11 resolutions in front of the Parliament for the future of the country.”

Title: Centre receives Rs 8,625 crore as disinvestment receipts so far in 2024-25
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 12:49:47 +0000
Content: The government has received Rs 8,625 crore through disinvestment receipts during the financial year 2024-25, with these funds raised through various minority stake sale transactions, MoS Finance Pankaj Chaudhary informed in a written reply to the Lok Sabha.
In response to a query on disinvestment targets over the last five years, the minister said that the government stopped setting specific disinvestment targets beginning in the 2023-24 financial year. For 2024-25, no disinvestment estimate or target has been set.
“So far, the Government has received Rs. 8,625 crore through various minority stake sale disinvestment transactions during the current financial year,” the minister said.
The government typically conducts disinvestment through minority stake sales and strategic disinvestments of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs).
Strategic disinvestment involves the full or substantial sale of government shareholding in a CPSE along with the transfer of management control. In the case of privatization, the government’s equity and management control in a CPSE are transferred to a private buyer, while in other instances, equity is transferred to another CPSE along with control.
“The policy on strategic disinvestment/privatization is based on the economic principle that Government should discontinue in sectors, where competitive markets have come of age and economic potential of such entities may be better discovered in the hands of strategic investor due to various factors such as infusion of capital, technological upgradation and efficient management practices,” the minister added.
Profitability or loss is, however, not among the relevant criteria for privatization or strategic disinvestment.
Disinvestment is an ongoing process, and execution/completion of specific transactions hinges upon market conditions, domestic and global economic outlook, geopolitical factors, investor interest and administrative feasibility.
The government, since 2016, has given ‘in-principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment of 36 cases of PSEs and/or Subsidiaries/Units/Joint Ventures of PSEs/Bank.

Title: GRAP stage III re-imposed in Delhi amid ‘very poor’ air quality
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 11:52:45 +0000
Content: The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) on Monday imposed Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) in Delhi after the city’s air quality deteriorated to the ‘very poor’ category.
The CAQM attributed the sharp decline in air quality to “highly unfavorable meteorological conditions,” which have exacerbated pollution levels.
The CAQM introduced a revised version of GRAP on December 13 to address the recurring problem of winter pollution in Delhi-NCR. GRAP is a set of emergency measures aimed at curbing pollution levels, implemented progressively depending on air quality severity. With calm winds and low mixing height exacerbating pollution levels, the CAQM stated that immediate action was necessary to mitigate the health risks posed by the deteriorating air quality.
In a statement, the CAQM said, “Considering the highly unfavourable meteorological conditions, including calm winds and very low mixing height, leading the AQI of Delhi into the higher end of the ‘very poor’ category, the CAQM Sub-Committee on GRAP has decided to impose Stage III with immediate effect in the entire NCR.”
The reimposition of Stage III introduces stricter measures across sectors to combat pollution. Schools and colleges in Delhi and adjoining areas, including Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, and Gautam Budh Nagar, will switch to hybrid learning for students up to Class V, enabling online education for those who opt for it.
To curb vehicular emissions, restrictions on inter-state buses entering Delhi will be tightened, permitting only electric, CNG, or BS-VI diesel vehicles. The Delhi government has also been instructed to ban diesel medium goods vehicles (MGVs) with BS-IV or older standards, except those carrying essential goods, within city limits. Non-essential diesel light commercial vehicles (LCVs) of BS-IV or older standards registered outside Delhi will also face restrictions.
The revised GRAP mandates additional responsibilities for Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs), which will now be required to provide electric heaters for workers such as sanitation staff and security personnel to discourage open burning of biomass or waste during the winter months.
Acknowledging the challenges faced by persons with disabilities, exemptions have been introduced for them from restrictions on BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles in Delhi and nearby districts.

Title: Won’t allow our land to be used in any manner that is detrimental to India’s interest: Lankan President Dissanayake
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 11:36:24 +0000
Content: Thanking India for its “immense support” during the unprecedented economic crisis, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake on Monday assured Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he will not allow the island nation to be used in any way that is detrimental to the interest of India.
“I have given an assurance to the Prime Minister of India that we will not allow our land to be used in any way in a manner that is detrimental to the interest of India. The cooperation with India will certainly flourish and I want to reassure our continued support to India,” Dissanayake said after holding discussions with PM Modi at New Delhi’s Hyderabad House.
Dissanayake, who arrived in India on Sunday evening on his first foreign visit after assuming office, expressed his gratitude to President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Modi for support and warm hospitality, emphasising that the ongoing visit has paved the way for further development of cooperation between the two neighbouring countries.
“We faced an unprecedented economic crisis two years ago and India supported us immensely to come out of that quagmire. It has also helped us immensely after that, especially in the debt-free structuring process. I know that Sri Lanka secures a very significant place in the foreign policy of India. PM Modi assured us full support and he also assured us that he will always protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Sri Lanka,” said the visiting President.
PM Modi during press conference said that he has assured the Lankan President that India will remain a trusted and reliable partner in Sri Lanka’s development efforts.
“We completely agree that our security interests are interlinked. We have decided to finalise the Defence Cooperation Agreement soon. Cooperation on hydrography has also been agreed upon. We believe that the Colombo Security Conclave is an important platform for regional peace, security and development. Under this, cooperation will be enhanced on topics like maritime security, counter-terrorism, cyber-security, fight against smuggling and organised crime, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief. The people-to-people relations between India and Sri Lanka are linked to our civilisations,” PM Modi said.
PM Modi said that both sides also had a detailed discussion on the issues related to the livelihood of fishermen.
While Prime Minister Modi suggested moving forward with a “humane approach” in the matter, Dissanayake said that a “durable and sustainable” solution is needed on the issue, that he said has become a “plague” for both the countries.
“There are bottom trawling systems being adopted by the fishermen in that area and that needs to be put an end to because that will spell doom to this industry,” he said.
The Lankan President lauded India’s “tremendous success” in digitising the public services and remarked that Sri Lanka is also taking the same path with PM Modi assuring him of support in the endeavour.
Dissanayake is also scheduled to meet Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar and participate in a business forum aimed at strengthening investment and trade ties between the two countries before travelling to Bodh Gaya.
The visiting delegation also includes Vijitha Herath – Sri Lanka’s Foreign Affairs, Overseas Employment, and Tourism Minister and the country’s Minister of Labour and Deputy Economic Development Minister Anil Jayanta Fernando.
Soon after his arrival on Sunday, the Lankan President had met with External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and National Security Advisor Ajit Doval.
“Extensive discussions were held between President Dissanayake and Minister Sitharaman on enhancing Indo-Sri Lankan economic cooperation and expanding investment opportunities between the two countries. The talks also covered bringing more Indian tourists to Sri Lanka, modernizing Sri Lanka’s agriculture sector, and developing digital infrastructure,” the Lankan President’s office said in a statement on Monday.

Title: Amit Shah lauds Chhattisgarh govt for action against Maoists
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 11:27:02 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Monday commended the Chhattisgarh government for its determined efforts in combating Maoism in the state.
Addressing a gathering in Jagdalpur, Shah praised the collaborative approach adopted by the state government and central agencies to tackle the issue effectively.
During his visit, Shah met with surrendered Maoists and their families, offering support and reassurance. He reiterated the government’s commitment to assisting those affected by the violence and emphasized the need for collective action to eradicate Maoism from the region.
“The Central government, in collaboration with the Chhattisgarh government, will ensure comprehensive support to the families impacted by Maoism. I appeal to everyone to join hands with the ongoing campaigns by both governments to eradicate this menace,” he said.
Shah highlighted the progress made in the past year, pointing to the reduction in Maoist activities and the neutralization of several top cadres. He credited the Chhattisgarh government’s leadership and strategic approach for the improvements, expressing confidence that Maoism will be eliminated from the country by March 31, 2026.
Shah also praised the leadership of Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai, Deputy Chief Minister Vijay Sharma, and the tireless efforts of state police and security forces. “The combined efforts of the Chhattisgarh government, police, and security agencies have laid a strong foundation for this campaign. I assure you all that the goal of a Maoism-free state will be realised within the set timeline,” he said.
The Home Minister highlighted various initiatives, including the signing of 20 peace accords in the northeast and the surrender of 9,000 militants. He also mentioned that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had approved 15,000 homes for surrendered Maoists under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, and the National Dairy Development Board would provide cows or buffaloes to help such families earn Rs 15,000 to Rs 20,000 per month.
In a post on X, HM said, “Maoism not only deprived the country’s large population of their fundamental rights for decades but also crossed all limits of inhumanity and adversely affected their lives. Maoists, who sow seeds of fear and greed in the minds of youth and lead them on the path of violence, are the biggest enemies of society. Our government under the leadership of Modiji is committed to the empowerment and all-round development of Maoist-affected people and the youth who have given up violence and joined the mainstream.”

Title: Strong kharif and rabi crop outlook eases India’s food inflation concerns
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 11:14:55 +0000
Content: The arrival of kharif crops in the market, coupled with a robust outlook for the rabi crop, bodes well for the food inflation outlook, economists said on Monday.
This positive sentiment comes as the wholesale price index (WPI) inflation eased to 1.9 percent in November, down from 2.4 percent in October.
The moderation in WPI inflation last month was primarily driven by a decline in food inflation.
“The arrival of fresh harvests has led to a seasonal correction in food prices,” said Rajani Sinha, Chief Economist at CareEdge Ratings.
“The outlook for agriculture remains positive, with good kharif production and conducive prospects for rabi sowing, thanks to healthy reservoir levels and good soil moisture from prolonged monsoons.”
Sinha added, “We expect WPI inflation to remain largely benign, averaging 2.3 percent in Q3 FY25 and around 2.5 percent for the full fiscal year.”
The WPI moderation was primarily led by a decline in primary food articles, which eased to a three-month low of 8.6 percent from 13.5 percent in the previous month. This exerted significant downward pressure on the headline inflation rate.
“Core (non-food manufacturing) WPI inflation inched up to 0.5 percent in November 2024 from 0.3 percent in October 2024, but remained below 1.0 percent for the fourth consecutive month,” noted Rahul Agrawal, Senior Economist at ICRA.
This easing in inflation is a welcome sign, especially since retail inflation crossed the RBI’s upper limit of 6 percent for the first time in October.
The central bank is waiting for retail inflation to stabilize at 4 percent before considering an interest rate cut to propel growth, which is widely anticipated early next year.

Title: Sensex Ends Lower, Nifty Bank Flat as Investors Await Fed Decision
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 11:03:35 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market closed lower on Monday amid mixed global cues.
At closing, the Sensex settled at 81,748.57, down by 384.55 points, or 0.47 percent, and the Nifty ended at 24,668.25, down by 100.05 points, or 0.40 percent.
The national market traded in a range-bound manner, while the realty sector outperformed in expectation of growing demand and a potential rate cut cycle in 2025, market experts said. A rise in manufacturing and service PMI suggests a positive turnaround in H2 FY25 earnings, which may limit further downgrades in FY25 earnings.
“Rising US 10-year bond yields and a strengthening dollar led investors to remain watchful of the upcoming US Fed policy and its commentary for 2025 rates,” the experts added.
The Nifty Bank ended at 53,581.35, down by 2.45 points, or 0.00 percent. The Nifty Midcap 100 index closed at 59,443 at the end of trading after rising 451.50 points, or 0.77 percent. The Nifty Smallcap 100 index closed at 19,531.05 after rising 123.75 points, or 0.64 percent.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), 2,338 shares ended in the green and 1,802 in the red, while 100 shares remained unchanged.
On the sectoral front, buying was witnessed in the auto, PSU bank, pharma, realty, media, and private bank sectors of the Nifty.
In the Sensex pack, Titan, UltraTech Cement, NTPC, TCS, Bharti Airtel, Tech Mahindra, Infosys, Hindustan Unilever, JSW Steel, HCL Tech, Tata Steel, Tata Motors, HDFC Bank, and Nestle India were the top losers. IndusInd Bank, Bajaj Finance, Power Grid, M&M, and Axis Bank were the top gainers.
The market is currently awaiting the US Federal Reserve (FED) meeting scheduled for December 17-18. The rupee traded at 84.87 as the dollar strengthened, holding above the $106.50 mark. The rupee’s trading range is expected to remain between 84.75 and 85.00 amid these developments, experts said.

Title: India and Sri Lanka sign key MoUs to strengthen bilateral ties
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 11:01:19 +0000
Content: India and Sri Lanka signed several Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) in New Delhi on Monday, aimed at expanding cooperation across multiple sectors. The agreements were signed in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who is on a three-day state visit to India.
During a joint press conference, PM Modi highlighted India’s ongoing support to Sri Lanka, saying that India has provided $5 billion in lines of credit and grant assistance to the island nation.
“We have cooperation in all 25 districts of Sri Lanka, and the selection of our projects is always based on the development priorities of the partner countries,” PM Modi said.
One of the key outcomes of the discussions was the decision to expedite a defence cooperation agreement between the two nations. PM Modi emphasized that both India and Sri Lanka recognize that their security interests are interlinked.
“We completely agree that our security interests are interlinked. We have decided to conclude the defence cooperation agreement soon. Cooperation on hydrography has also been agreed upon. We believe that the Colombo Security Conclave is an important platform for regional peace, security and development. Under this, cooperation will be enhanced on topics like maritime security, counter-terrorism, cyber-security, fight against smuggling and organised crime, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief,” PM Modi said.
Economic cooperation was another major focus, with both leaders underscoring the importance of investment-led growth and connectivity. PM Modi highlighted plans to strengthen physical, digital, and energy connectivity as the pillars of the partnership.
“Work will be done for establishing electricity grid connectivity and multi petroleum pipeline. Pace will be given to Sampur Solar Power Plant. LNG will be supplied for Sri Lankan Power plants. To boost bilateral trade, both sides will try to conclude the Ekta soon, ” PM Modi said.
PM Modi also outlined plans for the rehabilitation of key infrastructure, including the signalling system for the Maho-Anuradhapura railway section and the development of Kankesanthurai Port.
In education, starting next year, India will offer monthly scholarships to 200 students from universities in Jaffna and the Eastern Province. Furthermore, 1,500 Sri Lankan civil servants will receive training in India over the next five years.
India’s cooperation with Sri Lanka will also extend to sectors such as housing, renewable energy, agriculture, dairy, and fisheries. In addition, India will participate in Sri Lanka’s unique digital identity project.
PM Modi highlighted the deep cultural connections between the two countries, noting that when the Pali language was recognized as a “Classical Language” in India, it was celebrated in Sri Lanka as well.
Dissanayake’s state visit, which runs from December 15 to 17, marks his first bilateral visit to India since assuming office in September.

Title: India’s banking sector set for continued resilience amid strong economic growth: S&P Global
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 10:49:36 +0000
Content: India’s financial sector is set for continued resilience, driven by structural improvements and strong economic growth, according to S&P Global Ratings’ 2025 banking outlook.
“We expect asset quality to stabilize, with weak loans projected to decline to around 3.0% of gross loans by March 2025. This is supported by healthy corporate balance sheets and improved risk management,” said Deepali Seth-Chhabria, Analyst at S&P Global Ratings.
While underwriting standards for retail loans remain strong and delinquencies manageable, the rapid growth of unsecured personal loans may pose some risks.
S&P Global expects loan growth to slightly exceed nominal GDP, particularly in the retail segment, though deposit growth may lag, potentially affecting credit-to-deposit ratios.
Credit costs are expected to normalize from a decade-low of 0.8% in fiscal 2024 to a range of 0.8%-0.9%. Despite this, profitability should remain strong, with returns on average assets projected around 1.2% in fiscal 2025, she added.
The Reserve Bank of India’s increased regulatory oversight on compliance and governance may raise compliance costs but will ultimately enhance financial stability. Overall, the outlook for India’s financial sector remains stable as it adapts to these changes, the report concluded.
A recent RBI report also noted that the Indian financial system remains resilient, benefiting from broader macroeconomic stability.
The banking sector is well-capitalized, reflecting improved risk absorption, while the NBFC sector and Urban Cooperative Banks also show progress.
RBI Deputy Governor M. Rajeshwar Rao recently highlighted that the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) has been crucial in improving bank asset quality and facilitating pre-admission debt settlements exceeding Rs 10 lakh crore since its introduction in 2016, further strengthening banks.

Title: Australia dominate India amidst rain interruptions on day three in Brisbane
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 10:29:57 +0000
Content: Australia’s pacemen rattled through India’s top order on a rain-hit day three of the third test in Brisbane on Monday but the recurring wet weather put the brakes on the hosts’ charge.
India were 51 for four at stumps, trailing Australia’s first-innings total by 394 runs, as play was abandoned nearly an hour early due to bad light at the Gabba.
Opener KL Rahul was unbeaten on 33 with India skipper Rohit Sharma yet to score.
Australia’s bowlers could send down only 17 overs after being bowled out for 445 in the morning. Captain Pat Cummins did well to have Rishabh Pant caught behind for nine in the first over following a rain break before tea.
Two balls later, following a glorious cover drive for four by Rahul off Mitchell Starc, the players trudged off the ground as tea was called early.
More rain saw the resumption of play delayed after tea and when it finally kicked off again Australia were reduced to bowling only a couple of overs of spin due to poor light after paceman Starc had completed his earlier interrupted over.
It was a frustrating day for the loyal crowd of 16,180 but perhaps more so for the home team, whose chances of forcing a result were progressively eroded.
Adding to the angst, there is more rain forecast for days four and five.
Australia, nonetheless, dominated what play there was, continuing on from their superb day two when Travis Head and Steve Smith scored centuries to build a big total.
Starc took two wickets in six balls with the help of namesake Mitchell Marsh, while Josh Hazlewood removed Virat Kohli as India’s reply got off to a dreadful start.
Starc struck with the second ball of the innings, Yashasvi Jaiswal flicking a shot off his pads to be out for four, with Marsh jogging across from square leg to take an easy catch.
Big left-armer Starc then dismissed Shubman Gill for one as the number three drove at a full delivery to send a thick edge to Marsh, who leapt to his left in the gully to take a screamer of a catch.
Kohli lasted only 16 balls for his three runs, nibbling at a Hazlewood delivery to be caught behind.
Rahul survived, though, after wearing a painful blow on his wrist from Hazlewood’s first ball of the morning.
The hosts resumed in the morning on 405 for seven, adding 40 runs for their last three wickets.
Wicketkeeper Alex Carey contributed a valuable 70 before caught slogging, becoming recalled paceman Akash Deep’s first and only wicket of the innings.
Jasprit Bumrah finished with 6-76, adding Starc to his haul after the tailender made a useful 18, while Mohammed Siraj bowled Nathan Lyon for two to finish with 2-97.
The five-match series is tied at 1-1 with two matches to come in Melbourne and Sydney.

Title: India’s total exports rise to $67.8 billion in November
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 17:07:47 +0000
Content: India’s total exports, including merchandise and services, reached $67.79 billion in November 2024, reflecting a 9.59 percent growth compared to November 2023, according to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.
Merchandise exports during April-November 2024 totaled $284.31 billion, a 2.17 percent increase from $278.26 billion during the same period in 2023. However, merchandise exports for November 2024 amounted to $32.11 billion, down from $33.75 billion in November 2023, mainly due to reduced petroleum exports. Non-petroleum merchandise exports in November 2024 stood at $28.40 billion, marking a 7.75 percent growth from $26.36 billion in November 2023.
Key contributors to export growth in November 2024 included electronic goods, engineering goods, rice, marine products, and ready-made garments. Electronic goods exports rose by 54.72 percent, reaching $3.47 billion from $2.24 billion in November 2023. Engineering goods exports grew by 13.75 percent to $8.90 billion from $7.82 billion, while rice exports nearly doubled to $1.14 billion from $0.59 billion. Marine product exports increased to $0.76 billion, and ready-made garment exports reached $1.12 billion.
Total imports, including merchandise and services, for November 2024 were estimated at $87.63 billion, representing a 27.47 percent increase from November 2023. Gold imports for the month peaked at $14.8 billion. Total imports for April-November 2024 were estimated at $619.20 billion, reflecting a 9.55 percent rise.
The merchandise trade deficit widened to $37.84 billion in November 2024 from $27.14 billion, driven by the rise in gold imports.

Title: German parliament votes no-confidence in Chancellor Scholz, paving way for election

Content: The German parliament accepted Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s invitation to withdraw its confidence in him and his government on Monday, clearing the way for the Feb. 23 early election necessitated by the collapse of his government.
Scholz’s three-party coalition fell apart last month after the pro-market Free Democrats quit in a row over debt, leaving his Social Democrats and the Greens without a parliamentary majority just when Germany faces adeepening economic crisis.
Under rules designed to prevent the instability that facilitated the rise of fascism in the 1930s, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier can only dissolve parliament and call elections if the chancellor calls, and loses, a confidence vote.
Only 207 of the parliament’s 733 expressed confidence, while 394 withheld it.
“The motion has passed,” said parliament president Baerbel Bas.

Title: Gadhimai Mahotsav Continues to Be the World’s Biggest Animal Slaughter Event
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 16:20:19 +0000
Content: The world’s bloodiest festival continues to face criticism from animal activists campaigning vigorously for decades, but it did not stop more than two crore people from attending Gadhimai Mahotsav this year. This Hindu festival, held once every five years at the Gadhimai Temple in Bariyarpur, Bara district of Madhesh Province, Nepal, near the Indo-Nepal border, started on December 2 and concluded on Shukla Purnima, a Sunday.
The festival features the world’s largest animal sacrifice, occurring on Saptami, Ashtami, and Navami of the Lunar Calendar. Devotees sacrifice water buffaloes, goats, cocks, and ducks, and release doves in the temple premises when they believe their wishes have been fulfilled.
Animal sacrifices commence only after a shaman, as part of the rituals, offers his blood and sacrifices five forest animals: a rat, duck, cock, dove, and boar. According to a priest, a lamp lights up automatically following the shamanic sacrifice, signaling the Goddess’s readiness to accept further offerings. Devotees then proceed with offerings such as buffaloes, goats, cocks, and ducks. In the patriarchal traditions of the Terai and Gangetic belt, devotees often seek blessings for sons, with animal sacrifices made as thanks upon the birth of a boy.
Several NGOs, including Humane Society International, Sneha’s Care, and vegetarianism-promoting civil society groups, have long campaigned against the mass sacrifices during the Gadhimai Mahotsav. In the 2009 festival, over five lakh animals were slaughtered. Locals, however, assert that this practice is a more than 600-year-old ritual and an inviolable part of their faith. Political reluctance to intervene stems from fear of offending religious sentiments.
In 2024, the Supreme Court of India directed state governments to restrict the export and transport of animals intended for sacrifice. Nepal’s Supreme Court ordered a ban on animal sacrifices in 2019, but the ruling remains largely unenforced. Sacrifices now occur behind closed doors to prevent public viewing, with only devotees accompanied by animals permitted into the sacrificial grounds. The animals’ heads are offered to the Goddess, buried by the temple, and the carcasses are auctioned, with the meat frequently exported to China and other countries.
Locals reported a footfall of approximately 2.5 crore people during the 14-day festival, which included entertainment, sports, food stalls, and adventure activities. This inflow significantly boosts tourism, providing local communities with their highest earnings during this period. The substantial revenue generated by the event is a key factor in the lack of political will to discontinue animal sacrifices, as civil societies struggle to oppose these practices without appearing to interfere with deeply rooted religious beliefs.

Title: NDMC to install mist sprayers on electric poles to tackle air pollution
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 15:40:18 +0000
Content: The New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) has announced plans to install mist sprayers on electric poles as part of efforts to address air pollution. This initiative is aligned with the Ease of Living mission, a program under the government’s urban development agenda, Vice Chairperson Kuljeet Singh Chahal stated on Monday.
According to NDMC, the first phase will see the installation of 15 mist sprayers on electric poles along a 500-meter stretch of Lodhi Road. Each pole will have five nozzles, with six spray holes per nozzle, providing 30 spray points on each pole. The system is designed to use 81 liters of water per pole per hour. Four 5,000-liter capacity tanks will supply treated water from sewage treatment plants (STPs) to avoid the use of fresh water.
The project is expected to begin next year, with the first phase scheduled for completion within a defined timeline. Following its implementation on Lodhi Road, the NDMC plans to expand the project to other areas, including Shanti Path and Africa Avenue, before eventually rolling it out across the jurisdiction.
The NDMC has also deployed Mechanical Road Sweepers (MRS) equipped with GPS tracking to manage road cleaning, with real-time monitoring conducted at the Smart City Integrated Command and Control Centre. Other pollution control measures include the procurement of anti-smog guns and mist spray machines to mitigate dust and particulate matter.
Additionally, water tankers ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 liters in capacity are used for watering roadside greenery, employing treated water to conserve fresh resources. Tree plantation drives and dust control measures at construction sites are also part of NDMC’s efforts to improve air quality.
Chahal reaffirmed NDMC’s commitment to introducing sustainable pollution control strategies to address environmental challenges.

Content: The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has announced a 20% reduction in the prices of textbooks for classes 9 to 12, starting from the upcoming academic year.
NCERT Director Dinesh Prasad Saklani announced at an event on Monday. Saklani stated that this is the first time the prices of textbooks have been substantially reduced.
“This year, NCERT has brought in a lot of efficiency in paper procurement and also onboarded printers with the latest printing machines. NCERT has decided to pass on this benefit to the students of the country,” Saklani said.
He added, “All textbooks of grades 9-12 for the next academic year shall be retailed by NCERT at 20 percent lower price than the existing price. This is unprecedented in the history of NCERT.”
Textbooks for grades 1-8 will continue to be sold at Rs 65 per copy.
The announcement was made during the Bhumi Pujan for the construction of the auditorium at the NCERT Headquarters. Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan presided over the event, where an MoU was also signed between NCERT and Flipkart to increase the availability of NCERT textbooks.
Each year, NCERT prints around 4-5 crore textbooks in approximately 300 titles. Recently, NCERT has expanded its reach by partnering with e-commerce platforms, including Amazon, to facilitate nationwide access to genuine textbooks.

Title: SC agrees to examine PIL for pan-India safety guidelines for women’s protection
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 13:55:49 +0000
Content: The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to examine a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking the issuance of pan-India safety guidelines, reforms, and measures for the protection of women.  
A bench led by Justice Surya Kant, along with Justice Ujjal Bhuyan, issued a notice to the Union government, requesting a response on the matter.
The bench said, “We will have to examine where we are lacking to achieve the goal of punitive and penal law. There is not something wrong with the quantity of punishment, but something else.”
The case will be heard again in January 2025.
Senior advocate Mahalakshmi Pavani, representing the Supreme Court Women Lawyers Association, pointed out that despite stringent laws enacted by Parliament, issues like “unwillingness, corruption, and laxity in the police and administrative stakeholders” hinder the timely and effective enforcement of these laws. This, she argued, results in the absence of fear among criminals.
The PIL called on the Supreme Court to take judicial notice and establish strict guidelines with a focus on their time-bound implementation to prevent incidents of sexual violence against women.
Additionally, the plea sought the invocation of the ‘parens patriae’ doctrine to protect the fundamental rights of women, children, and the third gender in India, particularly concerning their rights to safety, dignity, bodily integrity, and a safe environment.
The petition highlighted the surge in crimes against women, girls, and infants, reported across several states such as Kolkata, Delhi, Bihar, Karnataka, Assam, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Odisha, Punjab, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Andhra Pradesh. It referenced the gangrape and murder of a 31-year-old trainee doctor in Kolkata on August 9, describing it as a “ghastly reminder” that the situation has not improved since the 2012 Nirbhaya case.
“The recent Kolkata gangrape of young lady trainee doctor is only one amongst the many which has highlighted the deep-rooted ineptness, red-tapism, bureaucratic cowardice by the law enforcement agencies, political hooliganism, and the brutal, nefarious and grisly state of affairs concerning the safety of women in India. From Nirbhaya Rape Case to Abhaya, the brutality has only manifested into an animalistic expression against women,” the petition said.
The PIL further noted that the safety of women in India is marred by “ineptness, red-tapism, bureaucratic cowardice by law enforcement agencies, political hooliganism, and brutal behavior from criminals.”
The petition also argued that instead of politicizing such sensitive issues, the government must prioritize the security of vulnerable citizens and increase funds for the safety of women, children, and the third gender.
The PIL emphasized that India often responds to sexual violence only after media trials following traumatic cases, which jolts and traumatizes the public.
Additionally, the PIL sought directions for schools to introduce gender sensitivity classes, along with sex education and regular workshops by qualified child psychologists. These would aim to educate boys and girls on biological changes during adolescence and how to handle them in a healthy way.
The plea also stressed the need for government efforts to develop and implement nationwide adolescent programs, in light of the increasing number of adolescent-related issues, including the lack of knowledge on gender equity, sexual harassment, abuse, legal age for marriage, and juvenile delinquency.

Title: PM Modi to launch infrastructure projects worth over ₹46,300 crore in Rajasthan
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 13:36:28 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit Rajasthan on December 17 to participate in the ‘Ek Varsh-Parinaam Utkarsh’ program, commemorating one year of the State Government of Rajasthan. During the event in Jaipur, PM Modi will inaugurate and lay the foundation stone for 24 infrastructure projects valued at over ₹46,300 crores. These projects span various sectors, including energy, road, railways, and water.
The projects include nine inaugurations and 15 foundation stone ceremonies. Of these, seven central government projects and two state government projects will be inaugurated, while nine central government projects and six state government projects will see their foundation stones laid.
Among the inaugurations is the Navnera Barrage, which aims to augment the state’s water resources, and a Smart Electricity Transmission Network with an Asset Management System. Railway electrification works for the Bhildi-Samdari-Luni-Jodhpur-Merta Road-Degana-Ratangarh section will also be inaugurated. A major bridge over the Mej River, part of the Delhi-Vadodara Green Field Alignment (NH-148N) project, will also be launched.
The foundation will be laid for additional water and energy infrastructure, including the construction of the Ramgarh Barrage and Mahalpur Barrage. Systems will also be initiated for transferring water from the Navnera Barrage to Bisalpur Dam and Isarda Dam through an aqueduct over the Chambal River. These projects are projected to cost over ₹9,400 crore.
PM Modi will also lay the foundation for solar energy projects, such as the installation of rooftop solar systems on government office buildings and the development of a 2000 MW solar park in Poogal, Bikaner. Two additional 1000 MW phases of solar parks will also commence under the project.
In the water sector, the visit includes the launch of a drinking water transmission line connecting Saipau (Dholpur) with Bharatpur-Deeg-Kumher-Nagar-Kaman & Pahari, as well as Chambal-Dholpur-Bharatpur retrofitting works.

Title: Centre receives Rs 8,625 crore as disinvestment receipts so far in 2024-25
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 12:49:47 +0000
Content: The government has received Rs 8,625 crore through disinvestment receipts during the financial year 2024-25, with these funds raised through various minority stake sale transactions, MoS Finance Pankaj Chaudhary informed in a written reply to the Lok Sabha.
In response to a query on disinvestment targets over the last five years, the minister said that the government stopped setting specific disinvestment targets beginning in the 2023-24 financial year. For 2024-25, no disinvestment estimate or target has been set.
“So far, the Government has received Rs. 8,625 crore through various minority stake sale disinvestment transactions during the current financial year,” the minister said.
The government typically conducts disinvestment through minority stake sales and strategic disinvestments of Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs).
Strategic disinvestment involves the full or substantial sale of government shareholding in a CPSE along with the transfer of management control. In the case of privatization, the government’s equity and management control in a CPSE are transferred to a private buyer, while in other instances, equity is transferred to another CPSE along with control.
“The policy on strategic disinvestment/privatization is based on the economic principle that Government should discontinue in sectors, where competitive markets have come of age and economic potential of such entities may be better discovered in the hands of strategic investor due to various factors such as infusion of capital, technological upgradation and efficient management practices,” the minister added.
Profitability or loss is, however, not among the relevant criteria for privatization or strategic disinvestment.
Disinvestment is an ongoing process, and execution/completion of specific transactions hinges upon market conditions, domestic and global economic outlook, geopolitical factors, investor interest and administrative feasibility.
The government, since 2016, has given ‘in-principle’ approval for strategic disinvestment of 36 cases of PSEs and/or Subsidiaries/Units/Joint Ventures of PSEs/Bank.

Title: Japan, India startups to study laser-equipped satellite to tackle space debris
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 07:31:13 +0000
Content: Space startups in Japan and India said on Tuesday they had agreed to jointly study using laser-equipped satellites to remove debris from orbit, an experimental approach to the increasingly imminent problem of orbital congestion.
Tokyo-based Orbital Lasers and Indian robotics company InspeCity said they would study business opportunities for in-space services such as de-orbiting a defunct satellite and extending a spacecraft’s life.
Carved out from Japanese satellite giant SKY Perfect JSAT this year, Orbital Lasers is building a system that will use laser energy to stop the rotation of space junk by vaporising small parts of its surface, making it easier for a servicing spacecraft to rendezvous.
Orbital Lasers plans to demonstrate the system in space and supply it to operators after 2027, said Aditya Baraskar, the company’s global business lead. It can be mounted on InspeCity satellites if the companies clear regulatory requirements in India and Japan, Baraskar added.
The companies said they had signed a preliminary agreement to initiate the collaboration. InspeCity was founded in 2022 and raised $1.5 million last year, while Orbital Lasers has raised 900 million yen ($5.8 million) since it was established in January.
A United Nations panel on space traffic coordination in late October said that urgent action was necessary to track and manage objects in low Earth orbit because of the rapid increase in satellites and space junk.
There are already more than 100 companies in the space servicing market as satellite constellations expand, Nobu Okada, chief executive of Japanese debris mitigation pioneer Astroscale, said earlier this year.
The project is the latest example of collaboration between Japan and India, whose governments are working together on the joint Lunar Polar Exploration (LUPEX) mission, which could launch as early as 2026.
Indian rocket maker Skyroot and satellite builder HEX20 are also working with Japanese moon exploration firm ispace on a future lunar orbiter mission.
The two countries’ commercial space tie-ups have been driven by Japanese satellite data solutions for India’s disaster management and agriculture, and can expand to more fields such as manufacturing, said Masayasu Ishida, chief executive of Tokyo-based nonprofit SPACETIDE, which has hosted space business conferences since 2015.
“The key is finding where and how to build complementary relationships” that align with national policies such as Make in India, which aims to boost local production, Ishida said.

Title: Amit Shah oversees signing of key agreements to boost Chhattisgarh’s forest produce and dairy sectors
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 06:46:34 +0000
Content: Amit Shah oversees signing of key agreements to boost Chhattisgarh’s forest produce and dairy sectors
In a bid to boost Chhattisgarh’s minor forest produce and dairy sectors, two significant agreements were signed in Raipur on Monday in the presence of Union Home Minister and Minister of Cooperation, Amit Shah.
These initiatives are in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘Sahkar Se Samriddhi’ (prosperity through cooperation) and aim to strengthen the cooperative movement in the state.
The first agreement, between the Chhattisgarh State Minor Forest Produce (Trading and Development) Cooperative Federation Limited (CGMFPFED) and the National Cooperative Organics Limited (NCOL), will provide better market access for certified forest produce, benefiting thousands of tribal farmers.
Speaking at the event, Shah underscored the role of cooperation in fostering prosperity for tribal communities and reducing the influence of Naxalism.
A second agreement was signed between the Chhattisgarh Government, the Chhattisgarh State Cooperative Dairy Federation, and the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) to revamp the state’s dairy sector.
This partnership will expand dairy cooperatives to every village, significantly increasing milk production. Shah highlighted how this initiative will empower women from marginalized communities and improve rural livelihoods.
The agreements support the Modi government’s emphasis on organic farming, offering certified organic products such as wild honey, cashew, and turmeric under the ‘Bharat Organics’ brand.
The initiatives aim to enhance farmers’ income, promote ecological sustainability, and bring organic products to both national and international markets.
Shah assured the Ministry of Cooperation’s full support in advancing these efforts, emphasizing that cooperation is key to driving both prosperity and peace in the region.

Title: Canada finance minister quits after clash with Trudeau over Trump tariffs, spending
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 06:38:48 +0000
Content: Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland quit on Monday after clashing with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on issues including how to handle possible U.S. tariffs, dealing an unexpected blow to an already unpopular government.
Freeland said she was quitting in the wake of a meeting last Friday with Trudeau, who asked her to take on a lesser post after the two had been arguing for weeks over spending.
Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc – a member of Trudeau’s inner circle – was quickly named finance minister of the minority Liberal government.
The resignation of Freeland, 56, who also served as deputy prime minister, is one of the biggest crises Trudeau has faced since taking power in November 2015. It also leaves him without a key ally when he is on track to lose the next election to the official opposition Conservatives.
A Liberal source said Trudeau wanted Freeland to serve as minister without portfolio dealing with Canada-U.S. relations in name only – in effect a major demotion.
Trudeau met the national Liberal caucus later on Monday – including Freeland – but legislators declined to say afterwards what had happened.
Labour Minister Steven MacKinnon said there had been a good and frank conversation but gave no details.
Trudeau later told a Liberal Party fundraiser in Ottawa that being prime minister was the privilege of his life.
“It’s obviously been an eventful day. It has not been an easy day,” he said.
The potential threat to his future was underlined when a top member of the opposition New Democrats, who have been helping keep the Liberals in power, said the party would vote to bring down Trudeau next year unless he quit.
“If we’re coming up to a straight up non-confidence motion at the end of February, early March, that’s one of the tools that we have,” House of Commons leader for the NDP Peter Julian told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
“We simply cannot continue like this,” he said, adding he expected Trudeau to have resigned by then.
Party leader Jagmeet Singh had earlier been less equivocal when asked about bringing down Trudeau, whom he insisted should resign.
Freeland quit just hours before she was due to present a fall economic update to parliament. The document showed the minority Liberal government had run up a 2023/24 budget deficit of C$61.9 billion, much higher than predicted.
Trudeau can be toppled if the opposition parties unite against him on a vote of no confidence, though that cannot happen until next year.
“Will the Prime Minister stay on? I think he will, but he’s certainly been seriously threatened … it could be that this is the event that will push him over the edge,” said Jonathan Malloy, a political science professor at Carleton University in Ottawa.
Parliament is due to break for Christmas on Tuesday and not return until Jan. 27.
Domestic media reports said Freeland and Trudeau had clashed over a government proposal for temporary tax breaks and other spending measures.
“For the last number of weeks, you and I have found ourselves at odds over the best path forward for Canada,” Freeland said in a letter to Trudeau posted on X.
Freeland said the threat of new U.S. tariffs represented a grave threat.
“That means keeping our fiscal powder dry today, so we have the reserves we may need for a tariff war. That means eschewing costly political gimmicks, which we can ill afford,” she wrote.
Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre said the government was spiraling out of control.
“We cannot accept this kind of chaos, division, weakness, while we’re staring down the barrel of a 25% tariff from our biggest trading partner,” he told reporters.
‘LEADERSHIP CRISIS’
“This will likely trigger a leadership crisis within the Liberal caucus … (it) is politically and personally devastating for Trudeau,” said Nik Nanos, founder of the Nanos Research polling firm.
Polls show the Liberals are set to be crushed in an election that must be held by late October 2025.
Freeland served as trade minister and then foreign minister before taking over the finance portfolio in August 2020. As minister, she oversaw the massive government spending campaign to deal with the damage done by COVID.
Trudeau has been under pressure for months from Liberal legislators alarmed by the party’s poor polling numbers, in part due to unhappiness over high prices, and the loss of two safe parliamentary seats in special elections.
The party is due to contest another special election in the province of British Columbia later on Monday.
‘BOMBSHELL’ DECISION
“This is quite a bombshell,” said Nelson Wiseman, political science professor at University of Toronto. “I think the problem the Liberals have is that they have no mechanism to remove Trudeau. Only a full blown caucus revolt could do that.”
Canada’s 10-year note yields CA10YT=RR climbed to their highest level since Nov. 28. They were last up 4.2 basis points at 3.2%. The Canadian dollarCAD= weakened to a four and a half year low at 1.4268 per U.S. dollar before reversing course.
When Trump came to power in 2017 he vowed to tear up the trilateral free trade treaty with Canada and Mexico. Freeland played a large role in helping renegotiate the pact and saving Canada’s economy, which is heavily reliant on the United States.
Although tensions between prime ministers and finance ministers are not unusual – Trudeau’s first finance minister quit in 2020 in a clash over spending – the level of invective in Freeland’s letter was remarkable by Canadian standards.
Freeland left the same day as Housing Minister Sean Fraser announced he was resigning for family reasons. Another six ministers have either already quit or announced they will not be running again in the next election.
Before entering politics in 2013, Freeland worked as a journalist and in senior editorial roles with several media companies, including the Financial Times, the Globe and Mail, and Reuters where she worked from 2010 to 2013.

Title: What is the significance of the Golan Heights?
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 06:28:26 +0000
Content: The Israeli government decided on Sunday to double its population on the occupied Golan Heights while saying threats from Syria remained despite the moderate tone of rebel leaders who ousted President Bashar al-Assad.
Israel captured most of the strategic plateau from Syria in the 1967 Six-Day War and annexed it in 1981.
After Assad fled Syria on Dec. 8, Israeli troops moved into a demilitarised zone inside Syria, including the Syrian side of strategic Mount Hermon, which overlooks Damascus, where its forces took over an abandoned Syrian military post.
Israel called the incursion a temporary measure to ensure border security.
Following is a quick guide to the hilly, 1,200-square-kilometre (460 square-mile) Golan Heights, a fertile and strategic plateau that overlooks Israel’s Galilee region as well as Lebanon, and borders Jordan.
WHY IS THE AREA CONTENTIOUS?
In 2019 then-President Donald Trump declared U.S. support for Israeli sovereignty over the Golan, but the annexation has not been recognised by most countries. Syria demands Israel withdraw but Israel refuses, citing security concerns.
Syria tried to regain the Golan in the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, but was thwarted. Israel and Syria signed an armistice in 1974 and the Golan has been relatively quiet since.
In 2000 Israel and Syria held their highest-level talks over a possible return of the Golan and a peace agreement. But the negotiations collapsed and subsequent talks also failed.
Netanyahu said on Sunday that he spoke on Saturday with Trump, who returns to the White House on Jan. 20. The Israeli leader said his country had no interest in conflict with Syria.
WHY DOES ISRAEL WANT THE GOLAN?
Security. Israel said earlier in Syria’s more than decade-long civil war that it demonstrated the need to keep the plateau as a buffer zone between Israeli towns and the instability of its neighbour.
Israel’s government also voiced concern that Iran, a longtime ally of the Assad regime, was trying to cement its presence on Syria’s side of the border in order to launch attacks on Israel. Israel frequently bombed suspected Iranian military assets in Syria in the years before Assad’s fall.
Israel and Syria have both coveted the Golan’s water resources and naturally fertile soil.
WHO LIVES ON THE GOLAN?
Some 31,000 Israelis have settled there, said analyst Avraham Levine of the Alma Research and Education Center specialising in Israel’s security challenges on its northern border. Many work in farming, including vineyards, and tourism. The Golan is home to 24,000 Druze, an Arab minority who practice an offshoot of Islam, Levine said.
Many of the Druze adherents in Syria were long loyal to the Assad regime. Many families have members on both sides of the demarcation line. After annexing the Golan, Israel gave the Druze the option of citizenship, but most rejected it and still identify as Syrian.
WHO CONTROLS THE SYRIAN SIDE OF THE GOLAN?
Before the outbreak of Syria’s civil war in 2011, there was an uneasy stand-off between Israeli and Syrian forces.
But in 2014 anti-government Islamist rebels overran Quneitra province on the Syrian side. The rebels forced Assad’s forces to withdraw and also turned on U.N. forces in the area, forcing them to pull back from some of their positions.
The area remained under rebel control until the summer of 2018, when Assad’s forces returned to the largely ruined city of Quneitra and the surrounding area following a Russian-backed offensive and a deal that allowed rebels to withdraw.
WHAT SEPARATES THE TWO SIDES ON THE GOLAN?
A United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) is stationed in camps and observation posts along the Golan, supported by military observers of the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO).
Between the Israeli and Syrian armies is a 400-square-km (155-square-mile) “Area of Separation” – often called a demilitarised zone – in which the two countries’ armed forces are not permitted under the ceasefire arrangement.
The Separation of Forces Agreement of May 31, 1974, created an Alpha Line to the west of the area of separation, behind which Israeli military forces must remain, and a Bravo Line to the east behind which Syrian military forces must remain.
Extending 25 km (15 miles) beyond the “Area of Separation” on both sides is an “Area of Limitation” in which there are restrictions on the number of troops and number and kinds of weapons that both sides can have there.
There is one crossing point between the Israeli and Syrian sides, which until the Syrian civil war began was used mainly by United Nations forces, a limited number of Druze civilians and for the transport of agricultural produce.
WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE ASSAD’S OUSTER?
Netanyahu’s government unanimously approved a more than 40-million-shekel ($11 million) plan on Sunday to encourage demographic growth in the Golan.
It said Netanyahu submitted the plan to the government “in light of the war and the new front facing Syria, and out of a desire to double the population of the Golan”.
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates condemned Israel’s decision, with the UAE – which normalised relations with Israel in 2020 – describing it as a “deliberate effort to expand the occupation”.
Israel has carried out hundreds of strikes on Syria’s strategic weapons stockpiles and military infrastructure, it says, to prevent them from being used by rebel groups that drove Assad from power, some of which grew from movements linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State.
Syria’s de facto leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, said on Saturday that Israel was using false pretexts to justify its attacks on Syria, but he was not interested in engaging in new conflicts as his country focuses on rebuilding.
Sharaa – better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani – leads the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that ousted Assad on Dec. 8, ending the family’s five-decade iron-fisted rule.
He said diplomatic solutions were the only way to ensure security and stability and that “uncalculated military adventures” were not wanted.
Israel Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement on Sunday that the latest developments in Syria increased the threat to Israel, “despite the moderate image that the rebel leaders claim to present”.

Title: North-East gateway to vast Southeast Asian markets, Scindia tells investors
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 05:28:03 +0000
Content: The North-East serves as India’s gateway to the South and investing in the region will give investors access to the vast Southeast Asian markets, Union Minister for Communications and Development of North Eastern Region (DoNER), Jyotiraditya Scindia, said on Monday.
Speaking at the ‘North East Trade and Investment Roadshow’ in Mumbai, the minister emphasised the region’s immense potential, which now stands ready to contribute to India’s growth with an impressive 11 per cent GDP growth rate.
“The development of infrastructure, human resources, and specialised sectors has positioned North-East India as a key player in the nation’s future,” he said.
Scindia emphasised the importance of building bridges between the vibrant business ecosystems of Mumbai and North-East, thereby ensuring a seamless path for growth and innovation.
The minister further outlined the region’s progress in various sectors, including tourism, renewable energy, sports and IT, and emphasised the need for a focused quality-driven approach for development of the region.
He assured investors that the region’s youth, high literacy rates, and abundant natural resources make it an ideal destination for investment, particularly in areas like sustainable agriculture, manufacturing, and technology.
“With policies in place to support business growth and a commitment to reducing red tape, North-East India is now offering a red carpet to investors, which will contribute to the growth of India, especially its youth,” said Scindia.
Tripura Chief Minister Professor (Dr) Manik Saha reaffirmed that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the North-East region, particularly Tripura, is witnessing remarkable growth.
Tripura, recognised as one of the most peaceful states, has demonstrated impressive economic performance with a per capita income of Rs 1,77,000, making it the second-largest GSDP contributor in North-East.
With robust infrastructure, including excellent road, water, air, and rail connectivity, and a supportive investment climate, the state is becoming a preferred destination for investors.
Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma said the state is witnessing transformative growth, driven by strong leadership with a focused investment and development strategy.

Title: Sensex, Nifty decline as trade deficit, weak exports weigh on investor sentiment
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 05:26:50 +0000
Content: Indian stock markets opened lower on Tuesday as weak export data and a record-high trade deficit in November dampened investor sentiment.
The Nifty slipped 0.3% to 24,599 points as of 09:20 a.m, while the Sensex fell 0.3% to 81,492.02.
Market experts cited the widening trade deficit as the key factor affecting sentiment. Ajay Bagga, a banking and market expert, emphasized the implications of November’s trade deficit, which surged to a record $37.8 billion from $27.1 billion in October. “The economic data underscores the need for intervention by the RBI. A rate cut is increasingly likely as the rising trade deficit poses risks of further rupee depreciation,” Bagga said.
Bagga criticized the RBI’s recent approach, adding, “The central bank has used over $50 billion in FX reserves to support the rupee, which has been counterproductive. A depreciation of the rupee could have boosted export competitiveness while curbing imports.” He further called for monetary easing and liquidity injections to address the economic challenges.
In sectoral performance, selling pressure dominated, with Nifty Bank, Nifty Auto, and Nifty IT indices opening in the red, while Nifty FMCG, Nifty Media, and Nifty Pharma recorded gains.
Among Nifty 50 stocks, 16 gained while 34 declined in early trading. Cipla, Tata Motors, Tech Mahindra, Adani Ports, and BEL emerged as top gainers, while Shriram Finance, Grasim, Reliance, Eicher Motors, and Britannia led the losers’ list.
Akshay Chinchalkar, Head of Research at Axis Securities, provided a technical outlook, said, “For today, resistance is seen between 24,726 and 24,800, with support in the 24,554–24,580 range. Notably, Friday’s low held at the Bollinger-middle line, suggesting active buyer interest despite reduced volumes and higher volatility expected in the coming sessions.”
In Asian markets, a mixed trend was observed. Japan’s Nikkei 225 rose 0.15%, and Taiwan Weighted gained 0.34%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, South Korea’s KOSPI, and Jakarta Composite registered declines of 0.39%.

Title: Trump says deal needed to stop Ukraine war, will talk to Putin and Zelenskiy
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 05:20:17 +0000
Content: President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy should be prepared to make a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin to bring an end to the nearly three-year-old Ukraine war.
“Gotta make a deal,” Trump said at a news conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida.
Trump said he would talk to Putin and Zelenskiy about bringing the war in Ukraine to an end, saying he is troubled by images of carnage from the conflict.
“It’s got to stop,” Trump said.
Trump did not give a direct answer when asked whether he believed Ukraine should cede territory to Russia as part of a negotiated settlement to end the war.
Trump said much of the territory in dispute has been reduced to rubble and that it would take a century to recover.
“I mean, there are cities that there’s not a building standing, it’s a demolition site,” he said.
He also said he had been shown pictures of body-strewn battlefields that reminded him of some of the grisly photographs from the 1861-1865 American Civil War.
Trump has said he would like to bring a quick end to the war but has been cagey on the details. He told Time magazine in an interview published last week that he had a “very good plan” to help but that if he reveals it now “it becomes almost a worthless plan.”

Title: Centre to introduce ‘One Nation, One Election’ Bill in Lok Sabha today
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 05:15:14 +0000
Content: The Centre is set to introduce the ‘One Nation, One Election’ (ONOP) Bill in the Lok Sabha today at noon, marking a significant step towards the proposal to hold simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and state assemblies across India.
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has issued a three-line whip to all its MPs, urging them to be present in the House during the introduction of the bill. The agenda for today’s Lok Sabha session includes the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, which will pave the way for simultaneous elections.
Union Law Minister Arjun Meghwal is expected to introduce the bill, which aims to bring about synchronized elections across the country. Along with the One Nation, One Election Bill, Meghwal is also likely to present legislation aimed at aligning elections in Delhi, Jammu and Kashmir, and Puducherry with the nationwide simultaneous elections.
The Union Cabinet had approved the bill earlier this month, following the recommendations of the High-Level Committee on Simultaneous Elections chaired by former President Ram Nath Kovind. The committee proposed the implementation of simultaneous elections in two phases: first, holding Lok Sabha and state assembly elections together, and later, conducting local body elections (panchayats and municipalities) within 100 days of the general elections. A common electoral roll for all elections was also recommended.
After the bill’s introduction, Arjun Meghwal is expected to seek approval from the Lok Sabha Speaker to refer the bill to a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) for wider consultations. The JPC will be constituted on a pro-rata basis, depending on the strength of MPs from various parties.
While the BJP and its allies in the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) have expressed support for the bill, several opposition parties, including Congress, Trinamool Congress, and DMK, have voiced strong opposition. Congress leader Digvijaya Singh raised concerns over the practicality of the bill, questioning what would happen if a state government falls before the scheduled elections. He argued that it would be unjust for a state to remain without a government for the rest of the term.
Jairam Ramesh, Congress MP, also demanded that the bill be referred to a Joint Parliamentary Committee for further discussions, stating that it undermines democratic principles. He pointed out that Congress had clearly opposed the proposal, as expressed in a letter by party president Mallikarjun Kharge to the Kovind committee last year.
Despite opposition concerns, the bill has been welcomed by the BJP-led NDA alliance, which claims that One Nation, One Election will save time, reduce election costs, and streamline the electoral process across the country.

Title: Rain pauses third Australia-India test after lunch; Smith redeems dropped catch to deny Rahul’s century at Gabba
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 04:55:05 +0000
Content: Rain delayed the resumption of play after lunch on day four of the third test between Australia and India in Brisbane on Tuesday.
India were 167 for six in reply to Australia’s first innings 445 at the Gabba, still needing 79 runs to avoid the follow-on.
Ravindra Jadeja was 41 not out at the break, with fellow all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy on seven.
Earlier, Steve Smith redeemed himself with a stunning catch to deny KL Rahul a rousing century and give Australia a vital breakthrough before lunch on day four of the third test in Brisbane on Tuesday.
Fielding at slip, Smith leapt to his right to pluck a one-hander after spinner Nathan Lyon induced an edge from opener Rahul, who fell for 84 as India went to lunch at 167 for six, still 79 runs from avoiding the follow-on.
The catch broke a stubborn 67-run partnership with recalled all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja which had given India hope of staving off a second successive defeat in the five-match series.
It was also a relief for Smith after he dropped a waist-high chance in the slips on the first ball of the morning by captain Pat Cummins to reprieve Rahul on 33.
Jadeja was 41 not out at the break, with fellow all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy on seven.
Though Australia have dominated the rain-hit test, time may deny the hosts from taking a 2-1 lead in the series after rain wiped out most of days one and three.
Australia’s task was made tougher by a calf problem for paceman Josh Hazlewood, who bowled only one over in the morning before a team spokesperson said he would be taken for scans.
Whichever way the match goes; the India captain Rohit Sharma will face more scrutiny after another failure with the bat.
He was caught behind for 10 nicking fast bowler Cummins with a lead-footed drive one ball after being softened up by a bouncer from the Australian skipper.
Rohit has 19 runs from his three innings in the series, having missed India’s victory in Perth while caring for his new-born son.
India, who resumed on 51 for four in the morning on Tuesday, trail Australia’s first innings 445 by 278 runs.
The series is level at 1-1.

Title: Combined liver, kidney transplant successfully done on 54-year-old man in Hyderabad
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 13:14:20 +0000
Content: Star Hospitals has successfully performed a simultaneous liver and kidney transplant on a 54-year-old critically ill patient, Rama Rao, a businessman from Ongole, Andhra Pradesh.  
 
The patient suffered from liver and kidney failure, compounded by multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, and hepatitis B infection. Diagnosed with liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, his condition worsened over time, leading to water retention in the body (ascites) and kidney failure, further complicating his health.  
 
Admitted to Star Hospitals’ Hepatology and Liver Transplant department, he presented with severe infection, low blood pressure, hepatic coma, and toxin accumulation in the blood due to combined liver and kidney failure. With less than a 10% chance of survival in such cases, stabilising the patient in the ICU and performing an urgent simultaneous liver and kidney transplant was critical.  
 
This extraordinary feat was made possible by the patient’s family, who demonstrated remarkable selflessness. The patient’s spouse donated a kidney, while his son donated a portion of his liver.  
 
The complex 12-hour surgery involved simultaneous operations on both donors and the patient in adjacent operating theatres. Both donors were discharged within a week in excellent condition, while the patient experienced a smooth recovery, marking a new lease on life.  
 
Dr. Mettu Srinivas Reddy, Director and Lead Surgeon at Star Liver Institute, highlighted the case’s complexity: “Multi-organ transplantation is a highly challenging procedure, especially for critically ill patients. Successfully conducting such a surgery using two family donors demands exceptional technical expertise and coordination. Our interdisciplinary team of over 50 specialists worked seamlessly to ensure success.”  
 
Dr. Golamari Srinivasa Reddy, Clinical Lead Consultant for Hepatology and Transplant Hepatology, explained the challenges in managing the patient: “Severe liver cirrhosis and kidney failure, especially when complicated by infection, can be fatal without immediate treatment. This case underlines the importance of specialised liver intensive care and screening for hepatitis B to prevent such conditions.”  
 
Dr. Sridhar, Director of Nephrology and Renal Transplant, emphasised the need for a kidney transplant: “With the patient’s kidney function severely impaired, a kidney transplant was vital. Without it, he would have required frequent dialysis, even post-liver transplant. A simultaneous procedure was crucial for sustainable recovery.”  
 
Dr. Ravindranath, Chief Mentor at Star Liver Institute, lauded the hospital’s capabilities: “This successful multi-organ transplant showcases the unmatched expertise of our medical team and our advanced facilities, making Star Hospitals a preferred destination for complex healthcare needs.

Title: Over 57,000 sewer and septic tank workers identified under NAMASTE scheme
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 12:18:06 +0000
Content: The National Action for Mechanised Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) scheme has profiled over 57,758 Sewer and Septic Tank Workers (SSWs) across India, with 54,574 workers validated so far, Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment, Ramdas Athawale, informed the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.
The initiative, launched in the 2023-24 fiscal year, seeks to ensure safety, dignity, and socio-economic empowerment for sanitation workers. It is being implemented across more than 4,800 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) under a collaboration between the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJ&E) and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).
The data reveals that sanitation work remains deeply entrenched in social inequalities, with 67.91% of the workers coming from Scheduled Castes (SC), followed by 15.73% from Other Backward Classes (OBC), 8.31% from Scheduled Tribes (ST), and 8.05% from the General category.
Over 16,791 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits and 43 safety devices kits for Emergency Response Sanitation Units (ERSUs) have been distributed to improve worker safety. Health benefits have been extended to 13,604 workers and their families through Ayushman cards. A capital subsidy of Rs. 13.96 crore has been granted to 503 sanitation workers and dependents for sanitation-related projects. Additionally, Rs. 2.85 crore has been disbursed to 226 workers for alternative self-employment opportunities. 837 workshops have been conducted across municipalities to raise awareness of safe sanitation practices and to train workers on preventing hazardous cleaning methods.
To eradicate unsafe manual cleaning practices, the government has focused on mechanization. Under the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 (SBM-U 2.0), Rs. 371 crore has been allocated to 26 states and Union Territories for procuring 2,585 desludging vehicles. This mechanization is expected to reduce health hazards and improve efficiency in sanitation work.
Furthermore, guidelines have been issued by MoHUA to all states and UTs, emphasizing strict safety procedures, the establishment of ERSUs, and the use of modern equipment for sewer and septic tank cleaning.
The integration of data from states like Tamil Nadu and Odisha into the central NAMASTE database is currently underway to ensure a more comprehensive outreach. The government is actively working to expand the scheme’s benefits to all sanitation workers nationwide.

Title: Western governments expand contacts with Syria’s new leadership
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 12:10:20 +0000
Content: German and French officials are due to meet representatives of Syria’s new governing authorities in Damascus on Tuesday, expanding Western contacts with the new administration after British diplomats met its leader Ahmed al-Sharaa late on Monday.
Nine days after Bashar al-Assad was ousted, the new prime minister installed by Sharaa’s Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group said the government was grappling with very low currency reserves and called for sanctions to be lifted.
Western states are gradually opening channels to the new authorities in Damascus led by HTS, though they continue to designate it as a terrorist group.
Late on Monday, Sharaa, formerly known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, met a British foreign ministry delegation. He stressed the need for the restoration of ties and lifting sanctions on Syria so that Syrian refugees can return home, the Syrian state news agency SANA reported.
Photos published by SANA showed Sharaa, whose group was part of al Qaeda until he broke ties in 2016, sitting in a suit with an open shirt during the meeting, his highest level encounter yet with a Western government official since HTS seized power.
The images underline the geopolitical shift since Assad was toppled by HTS-led forces, a blow to Assad’s Russian and Iranian allies which could potentially open the way for Western states to reopen contacts with Damascus.
But for now at least, any Western overtures require manoeuvring around both the terrorism designation imposed on HTS during its days as an al Qaeda affiliate and financial sanctions imposed on Damascus under Assad.
Sharaa “spoke about the need to build a state of law and institutions, and establishing security,” SANA reported. “He also spoke about Britain’s important role internationally.”
Ahead of the meeting, British foreign minister David Lammy said London had sent a delegation of senior officials to Damascus to meet with the new interim Syrian authorities and civil society groups.
German diplomats are also planning talks with representatives of HTS in Damascus on Tuesday, the German foreign ministry said.
A German foreign ministry spokesperson said the talks would focus on a transitional process for Syria and the protection of minorities.
“The possibilities of a diplomatic presence in Damascus are also being explored there,” the spokesperson added in a statement, reiterating that Berlin was monitoring HTS closely in light of its roots in al Qaeda ideology.
“As far as one can tell, they have acted prudently so far,” the spokesperson said.
The new administration in Damascus has set out few details on its thinking for the next steps, even as it has swiftly established control over state institutions.
The justice of Islam
In an interview with Al Jazeera Mubasher, the newly installed Prime Minister Mohammed al-Bashir said the defence ministry would be restructured using using former rebel factions and officers who defected from Assad’s army.
Asked what he would say to those worried about a single religious or political group dominating Syria, Bashir said: “Those who are afraid…of a religion trend or anything else doesn’t truly understand Islam, the forgiveness of Islam, the justice of Islam”.
“Syria is for all Syrians,” he said. “Everyone is a partner for us building the Syria of the future.”
Bashir, who formerly led an HTS-affiliated government in Idlib province, has said he will remain in office until March.
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on Monday the European Union should be ready to ease sanctions on Syria if the country’s new leadership takes “positive steps” to establish an inclusive government and respect women’s and minority rights.
The Syrian conflict, which spiralled out of 2011 uprising against Assad’s repressive rule, drove millions of Syrians abroad as refugees, including around 1 million who went to Germany.
French diplomats are also expected to visit Damascus later on Tuesday to meet HTS representatives, French officials said.
The U.S. State Department said on Monday that the U.S. government has had more than one communication with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) over the past week.

Title: South Korean authorities fail to raid presidential office again, Yonhap says
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:56:30 +0000
Content: South Korean investigators probing President Yoon Suk Yeol’s short-lived martial law declaration failed to gain entry to his office to seek evidence on Tuesday after presidential office security staff denied them entry, Yonhap news agency reported.
Yoon was impeached on Saturday over his martial law decree and suspended from his presidential duties. Yonhap said that investigators looking for evidence about the legality of Yoon’s martial law decision waited for about seven hours to be let in, but the presidential office security service denied them entry.
A joint investigation team including police and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) was trying to access computer servers of the presidential office’s security service to get records of phones including one used by the police commissioner, Yonhap said, citing the team.
This would be the second time authorities have tried and failed to raid the presidential office over the declaration of martial law that was reversed within hours after a standoff with parliament.
An attempt on Dec. 11 ended without entry, but the presidential office voluntarily submitted some data.
The presidential office’s security service said it would express its position on Wednesday concerning cooperation with raids, Yonhap reported.
The police and the presidential office did not have an immediate comment on Tuesday. The CIO declined to comment.
Since his last public remarks shortly after he was impeached by parliament in a vote on Saturday, Yoon has kept a low profile and authorities and the Constitutional Court have not been able to contact or summon him, according to the court and officials.
Yoon has been putting together legal teams to defend himself against accusations of insurrection and in the Constitutional Court case which will decide whether to remove him from office or restore his powers.
Seok Dong-Hyun, a lawyer and an ex-prosecutor who helps Yoon, told reporters on Tuesday that the president’s declaration of martial law did not constitute insurrection, Yonhap reported.
Yoon would also “confidently express his position in the (Constitutional) Court”, Yonhap cited Seok as saying.
Seok declined to say whether Yoon would comply with a summons to appear for questioning on Dec. 21, and said authorities needed to streamline current investigations being conducted by several agencies at once, including the prosecution, the police and the CIO, Yonhap reported.
Seok could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters.
Meanwhile, South Korea’s acting president Han Duck-soo on Tuesday called during a cabinet meeting for next year’s government budget to be swiftly implemented from the start of 2025 in order to help revive the country’s slowing economy.
Han has been working to reassure South Korea’s allies and calm financial markets since taking over the duties of Yoon after the president was impeached.
The government has decided to frontload 75% of its 2025 budget to be implemented during the first half of the year, the finance ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
South Korea faces economic challenges, including heightened uncertainty for the trade-dependent country created by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to hike tariffs, as export growth in Asia’s fourth-largest economy slowed for a fourth-straight month in November, to the weakest level in 14 months.
The foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday it launched a task force to respond to the new Trump administration’s foreign policies.

Title: Mayotte authorities fear hunger, disease after cyclone; death toll rises in Mozambique
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:36:00 +0000
Content: Authorities in Mayotte were racing on Tuesday to stop hunger, disease and lawlessness from spreading in the French overseas territory after the weekend’s devastating cyclone, while Mozambique reported dozens of deaths from the storm.
Hundreds or even thousands could be dead in Mayotte, which took the strongest hit from Cyclone Chido, French officials have said. The storm laid waste to large parts of the archipelago off east Africa, France’s poorest overseas territory, before striking continental Africa.
With many parts of Mayotte still inaccessible and some victims buried before their deaths could be officially counted, it may take days to discover the full extent of the destruction.
So far, 22 deaths and more than 1,400 injuries have been confirmed, Ambdilwahedou Soumaila, the mayor of the capital Mamoudzou, told Radio France Internationale on Tuesday morning.
“The priority today is water and food,” Soumaila said. “There are people who have unfortunately died where the bodies are starting to decompose that can create a sanitary problem.”
“We don’t have electricity. When night falls, there are people who take advantage of that situation.”
Twenty tonnes of food and water are due to start arriving on Tuesday by air and sea. The French government said late on Monday it expects 50% of water supplies to be restored within 48 hours and 95% within the week.
France’s interior ministry announced that a curfew would go into effect on Tuesday night from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. local time.
Rescue workers have been searching for survivors amid the debris of shantytowns bowled over by 200 kph (124 mph) winds.
Chido was the strongest storm to strike Mayotte in more than 90 years, French weather service Meteo France said. In Mozambique, it killed at least 34 people, officials said on Tuesday. Another seven died in Malawi.
Drone footage from Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado province, already experiencing a humanitarian crisis due to an Islamist insurgency, showed razed thatched-roof houses near the beach and personal belongings scattered under the few palm trees still standing.
Illegal Immigration
French President Emmanuel Macron said after an emergency cabinet meeting on Monday that he would visit Mayotte in the coming days, as the disaster quickly fuelled a political back-and-forth about immigration, the environment and France’s treatment of its overseas territories.
Mayotte has been grappling with unrest in recent years, with many residents angry at illegal immigration and inflation.
More than three-quarters of its roughly 321,000 people live in relative poverty, and about one-third are estimated to be undocumented migrants, most from nearby Comoros and Madagascar.
The territory has become a stronghold for the far-right National Rally with 60% voting for Marine Le Pen in the 2022 presidential election runoff.
France’s acting Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, from the conservative Republicans party, told a news conference in Mayotte that the early warning system had worked “perfectly” but many of the undocumented had not come to designated shelters.
Other officials have said undocumented migrants may have been afraid to go to shelters for fear of being arrested.
The toll of the cyclone, Retailleau said in a later post on X, underscored the need to address “the migration question”.
“Mayotte is the symbol of the drift that (French) governments have allowed to take hold on this issue,” he said. “We will need to legislate so that in Mayotte, like everywhere else on the national territory, France retakes control of its immigration.”
Left-wing politicians, however, have pointed the finger at what they say is the government’s neglect of Mayotte and failure to prepare for natural disasters linked to climate change.
Socialist Party chairman Olivier Faure blasted Retailleau’s comments in an X post.
“He could have interrogated the role of climate change in producing more and more intense climate disasters. He could have rallied against the extreme poverty that makes people more vulnerable to cyclones,” said Faure.
“No, he has resumed his crusade against migrants.”
Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, appointed last week to steer France out of a political crisis, faced criticism after he went to the town of Pau, where he is the mayor, to attend a municipal council meeting on Monday, instead of visiting Mayotte.

Title: Israeli airstrikes kill 14 Palestinians in Gaza, tanks push south
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:16:07 +0000
Content: Israeli military strikes across the Gaza Strip killed at least 14 Palestinians on Tuesday, at least 10 of them in one house in Gaza City, medics said as tanks pushed deeper towards the western area of Rafah in the south.
Medics said the Israeli airstrike on the house in the Daraj suburb of Gaza City destroyed the building and damaged nearby houses. Four other people were killed in two separate airstrikes in the city and the town of Beit Lahiya north of the enclave said medics, medics added.
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.
In Rafah, near the border with Egypt, Israeli tanks pushed deeper towards the western area of Mawasi, known as a humanitarian-designated area, residents said.
Heavy fire from tanks rolling into the area forced dozens of families sheltering there to flee northwards towards Khan Younis.
The war began when the Palestinian militant group Hamas stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel then launched an air and land offensive that has killed more than 45,000 people, mostly civilians, according to authorities in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip.
The campaign has displaced nearly the entire population and left much of the enclave in ruins.

Title: Market Jitters: Indian Shares Tumble Ahead of Global Rate Decisions
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:04:26 +0000
Content: Indian stocks closed sharply lower on Tuesday, dragged down by selling across major sectors including PSU banks, auto, IT, financial services, pharma, FMCG, metal, and realty. The decline comes as investors brace for crucial policy decisions from global central banks, particularly the US Federal Reserve, which is holding its last policy meeting of the year on Tuesday and Wednesday.
The Sensex ended the day at 80,684.4, down 1,064.12 points or 1.30%, while the Nifty fell 332.25 points, or 1.35%, to close at 24,336.
Market experts point to widespread pessimism ahead of policy announcements from the US Fed, Bank of Japan, and Bank of England. While a 25 basis point rate cut from the US Fed is largely expected, investors remain wary of any hawkish signals that could indicate further tightening.
The Nifty Bank also felt the pressure, closing at 52,834.80, down 746.55 points, or 1.39%. The Nifty Midcap 100 index and Nifty Smallcap 100 index dropped 0.57% and 0.68% respectively.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), 1,578 shares advanced while 2,440 declined. The media sector was the only one to show gains.
Among the Sensex constituents, major losers included Bharti Airtel, IndusInd Bank, JSW Steel, TCS, Asian Paints, L&T, Bajaj Finserv, Reliance, Nestle India, HDFC Bank, Maruti, M&M, Tata Steel, and Power Grid. ITC was the sole gainer amongst the top performers.
The Indian rupee remained relatively stable near 84.90 against the US dollar as markets await the Fed’s final policy decision of the year on December 18.
“A dovish tone from the Fed could weaken the dollar index, offering some relief to the rupee,” said Jateen Trivedi, VP Research Analyst – Commodity and Currency, LKP Securities. “However, any uncertain or hawkish remarks may strengthen the dollar and maintain downward pressure on the rupee. We anticipate the rupee to trade between 84.75 and 85.05.”

Title: Punjab: Missing The Forest For The Trees
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:02:31 +0000
Content: A dispassionate conversation around Punjab is critically urgent, so much that it should have happened five years ago. For a while now, the discourse on Punjab has been lost to misplaced emotions, centered around the political agenda of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the ruling party in the state.
The recent assassination attempt on Sukhbir Singh Badal, the former Deputy Chief Minister and leader of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), is another testament to the growing troubles within the state. Law and order under the Bhagwant Mann government has been a subject of perpetual discussion and alarm. However, the state government and its representatives outside Punjab, including the former Chief Minister of Delhi, remain unperturbed.
Much to the dismay of the people of Punjab, disruption is the new forced reality. The law and order in the state is under threat from issues that lay dormant for over three decades, but are now crawling back to the mainstream. The Centre, not oblivious to the developments, has been leading a crackdown against the radical elements, wherever necessary, but the state government must play its role with far more responsibility.
There are several fundamental differences in the Punjab of 1984 and 2024. One, there is no resonance or audience for any movement against the state, not even remotely. Two, the Centre has a nationalist government at the helm with a far more mature understanding and realisation of the threats to Punjab. Three, the state is far more evolved, culturally and socially, and has discarded the baggage of the 1980s. However, the critical difference lies in the economic stature of Punjab, and that is where the focus must lie.
Punjab’s age of prosperity, driven by the Green Revolution, began in the 1960s. Even as violence engulfed the state across the 1980s, Punjab’s agricultural prosperity continued, along with Haryana.
Agriculture has been the bedrock of Punjab’s economy, but in the last few years, there has been a tectonic shift in the state, largely reliant on two crops, wheat and paddy, which cover close to 85 per cent of the cultivated area. This shift is both natural and inevitable, a virtue of the cycle of time, and one the state government is too stubborn to accept and prepare for.
Complement this stagnation in agriculture with the inability of the current and previous state government, under the Congress, to push forward manufacturing and services in the state, and the worries aggravate. The debt is projected to balloon to Rs. 3.74 lakh crore by the end of this fiscal year, amounting to more than 46 per cent of the state’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
In 2024-25, over Rs. 9,000 crore has already been allocated for power subsidy. The debt projected to be served this year exceeds Rs. 36,000 crore, including Rs. 24,000 crore (approximately), committed to interest payments. The problem is not merely the debt, but the state’s inability to raise revenues, as endless subsidies continue to plague the balance sheet.
The state government’s inability to raise the capital expenditure is no surprise. However, the Centre’s monetary efforts must not be squandered by the state government.
For instance, the protests for the acquisition of land for the Jamnagar-Amritsar highway, even when the land has already been acquired and the farmers have been paid, set a worrying precedent. Disrupting Centre’s capex spree in the state will only deter private sector investments in the long-run. The state desperately requires assets that can act as catalysts for revenue generation in the long-run, and it all begins with infrastructure.
Not development but protests have been making news when it comes to Punjab. Protests, redundant and without rationale, lost the sympathy and support of the general public in 2020-21, and yet, have continued, even if in scattered capacity, within the state and against the state government.
Along the stretch of the Grand Trunk Road in Punjab, running from Rajpura to Ambala, bordering Haryana, the protesters were prepared for another winter march to Delhi. The results on October 8 thwarted those plans, leaving the protesters squandering around the Shambhu border.
The stretch, indispensable to the economy of Punjab, remains blocked, as the national highway has become an illegal encroachment spot for parked tractors and temporary camps. Shambhu is perhaps the new Singhu, but much to the relief of the people of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Delhi, Singhu is not going to witness an economic blockade again. The Centre has done its part in 2021 itself, and it is now up to the Bhagwan Mann government to solve this problem.
The futility of these protests does not get much attention in the mainstream media, unfortunately.
The futility of the protests must be called out. Congress, in Delhi, talks about legalising MSP (Minimum Support Price) but miserably fails when it comes to giving a fiscal feasibility plan. The Karnataka Congress government, in November 2024, rejected the paddy crop from Punjab, citing quality issues. Beyond the theatrical political activism, Congress in Delhi has no plan for Punjab and its economy.
Punjab’s economy will not be rescued by a legal MSP provision. The government, even if it decides to generously and mindlessly spend Rs. 10 lakh crore annually, the projected cost for legalising MSP, and an amount equal to our capex allocation, (the Centre’s expenditure for 2024-25 is budgeted at Rs. 48 lakh crore), the problems will still persist. Punjab’s budget borrows from its future, while its agriculture, endlessly, borrows from its ecology.
Contrary to popular misconception, the Centre has been aiding the farmers in Punjab monetarily. In the ongoing marketing season, over 7.7 lakh farmers have benefited, and in the earlier Rabi marketing season, over 21 lakh farmers were benefited with almost Rs. 60,000 crore paid for wheat procurement alone. The money will never run out, but the water is.
This is where the Narendra Modi government’s proposal to the farmers of Punjab was both economically sound and rooted in ecological realities. In order to create a financial security net for farmers to diversify away from water-intensive crops, the government offered to procure pulses, maizes, and cotton, at MSP, for five years, and with no upper limit of procurement. The farmers, however, buoyed by the state government, rejected the offer.
The window to make economic amends is narrowing. Punjab and its politics must ensure that they do not miss the forest for the trees. Too caught up in specifics, the current and past state government have been unwilling to read the room. The Aam Aadmi Party, both in Delhi and Punjab, in its exuberance, are writing political checks that the state’s economic capital cannot cash. At stake here is the state’s future.
Punjab must draw lessons from its past to not repeat history. The route to political instability goes through an economic crisis. A prospering economy leaves no room for the political vacuum to be taken over by anti-national elements.
What worked for Punjab for six decades is no longer working in the agricultural space. Taking a cue from Jammu where the lavender revolution is making headlines, Himachal Pradesh which has become a national player in horticulture, and Haryana that is embracing diversification and technology, the state must innovate.
Agriculture can have a domino effect on other sectors, creating opportunities in food processing and logistics, thus having a direct bearing on farm incomes and employment, and that can be the beginning of the rejuvenation of the state economy. Is there anyone within the state polity willing to play the long-game along with Delhi, remains the question.

Title: “Double engine govt becoming symbol of good governance,” says PM Modi at the ‘Ek Varsh-Parinaam Utkarsh’ programme
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 10:52:53 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday praised the Bhajanlal Sharma-led BJP government in Rajasthan, saying that the double-engine governance model has become a symbol of good governance. Addressing the ‘Ek Varsh-Parinaam Utkarsh’ programme in Jaipur, organized to celebrate one year of the BJP government in the state, PM Modi highlighted the increasing trust of the people in the BJP, referencing recent electoral victories in Maharashtra, Haryana, and the Lok Sabha elections.
“BJP’s double-engine government is the guarantee of good governance. The overwhelming support for the BJP in states and at the national level reflects the people’s faith in our policies. We have been given the opportunity to serve the nation in the Lok Sabha for a third consecutive term—a rare feat in the past 60 years. Recent victories in Maharashtra and Haryana further cement this trust,” said PM Modi.
He lauded Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma for bringing “new momentum and direction” to Rajasthan’s development and inaugurated infrastructure projects worth over ₹46,300 crore, aimed at resolving water issues, boosting connectivity, and creating employment opportunities in the state.
“Today marks not just one year of governance but a celebration of Rajasthan’s progress. These projects will make Rajasthan one of the most connected states in the country and provide solutions to its water challenges. They will also enhance investment opportunities, benefiting the youth, farmers, and tourism industry,” said PM Modi.
During the event, Prime Minister Modi inaugurated 9 projects worth over Rs 11,000 crore, including 7 central government projects and 2 state government initiatives, and laid the foundation stone for 15 projects worth over Rs 35,300 crore, comprising 9 central and 6 state projects.
The inaugurated projects include the Navnera Barrage, Smart Electricity Transmission Network and Asset Management System, Railway Electrification of the Bhildi-Samdari-Luni-Jodhpur-Merta Road-Degana-Ratangarh section, and Package 12 of the Delhi-Vadodara Green Field Alignment (NH-148N). These projects aim to enhance connectivity, energy efficiency, and sustainable infrastructure development in Rajasthan, aligning with PM Modi’s vision of green energy and modernization.
The foundation stones were also laid for the construction of Ramgarh Barrage and Mahalpur Barrage, and the water transfer systems from Navnera Barrage to Bisalpur Dam and Isarda Dam via aqueduct on the Chambal River, at a cost exceeding Rs 9,400 crore.
The Prime Minister emphasized the importance of solar energy in Rajasthan’s development. He announced plans for the installation of rooftop solar plants on government buildings, the development of a 2000 MW solar park and two phases of 1000 MW solar parks in Poogal (Bikaner), alongside other initiatives in renewable energy.
Additionally, PM Modi laid the foundation stone for critical infrastructure projects such as the Luni-Samdari-Bhildi Double Line, the Ajmer-Chanderiya Double Line, and the Jaipur-Sawai Madhopur Double Line railway projects, as well as a drinking water transmission line from Saipau (Dholpur) to Bharatpur and Chambal-Dholpur-Bharatpur retrofitting works.
PM Modi criticized the previous Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government for its misgovernance, accusing it of turning paper leaks and recruitment fraud into Rajasthan’s identity. “The Congress government wronged Rajasthan’s youth, but the BJP has taken strict action, arrested culprits, and ensured fair recruitments. We have also provided relief by addressing high fuel prices in the state,” he said.
A significant highlight of the event was the signing of a memorandum of agreement between the Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh governments for the modified Parvati-Kalisindh-Chambal river interlinking project, a step aimed at boosting water harvesting and conservation. The project was part of the BJP’s broader vision, tracing back to former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, whose river interlinking initiatives were stalled by Congress for years.
“The BJP is committed to empowering women, youth, farmers, and the underprivileged. Connecting rivers has been a long-held dream, and now, it is becoming a reality under our governance,” PM Modi emphasized, recalling Vajpayee’s vision for water conservation.
The infrastructure projects inaugurated include green energy initiatives and enhanced rail and road connectivity. PM Modi declared that these projects would transform Rajasthan into a hub of connectivity and economic opportunity.

Title: India’s school education advances in infrastructure and digital access: Dharmendra Pradhan
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 10:28:47 +0000
Content: India’s school education system has seen steady progress over the past decade, with key initiatives focused on infrastructure development, digital inclusion, promotion of regional languages, and equity in education. Addressing a press conference in New Delhi, Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan outlined these developments, emphasizing the holistic growth in school education under the government’s leadership.
Pradhan highlighted advancements in school infrastructure between 2013-14 and 2023-24. The availability of electricity in schools increased from 53% to 91.8%, while computer access improved from 24.1% to 57.2%. Internet facilities also witnessed growth, rising from 7.3% to 53.9%. Access to basic facilities such as drinking water increased from 83.2% to 98.3%, and handwashing facilities grew from 43.1% to 94.7%. Playground availability improved from 66.9% to 82.4%, and library facilities expanded from 76.4% to 89%. The government also addressed accessibility by increasing the availability of ramps from 56.8% to 77.1% and handrails from 33.9% to 52.3%. Rainwater harvesting infrastructure was implemented in more schools, growing from 4.2% to 28.4%.
The government increased its expenditure on education. Per-child expenditure grew from ₹10,780 in 2013-14 to ₹25,043 in 2021-22, marking an upward trend in funding dedicated to school education.
The minister also discussed the promotion of Bharatiya languages in school curricula. Textbooks for Classes 1 and 2 are now available in 23 Indian languages, and multilingual e-content in 126 Indian languages and 7 foreign languages has been developed on the DIKSHA platform. The government has launched educational channels catering to diverse audiences, including a Tamil-language channel in 2024, the ULLAS channel for adult education in September 2024, and a channel for hearing-impaired learners in Indian Sign Language by December 2024.
Student performance in board examinations has shown improvements over the years. There has been a 64% increase in the number of students securing higher grades in Class X and a 66% rise in performance in Class XII board exams.
The role of women in education has also been crucial, with the number of female teachers increasing by over 30% since 2014. Between 2014 and 2024, over 61% of teaching posts have been filled by women, who now represent the majority of the teaching workforce.
Pradhan emphasized advancements in quality and equity in Kendriya Vidyalayas (KVs) and Navodaya Vidyalayas (NVs). The representation of rural students in NVs rose from 78% in 2014 to 90% in 2024. The introduction of OBC reservations in 2021 increased the representation of students from these backgrounds to 38.83% in NVs and 29.33% in KVs by 2024. Furthermore, more than 45,000 students from these institutions qualified for NEET, and over 2,000 students secured IIT admissions without external coaching.
The number of CBSE-affiliated schools doubled between 2014 and 2024, growing from 14,974 to 30,415. Vocational education in schools also expanded, with the number of schools offering vocational courses increasing from 960 in 2014 to 29,342 in 2024. Enrollment in vocational education grew from 58,720 in 2014 to over 30.8 lakh in 2024.
Technology-driven reforms have also streamlined various processes, including admissions, teacher transfers, and CBSE affiliations. Schools have transitioned to e-office platforms, improving administrative functions and enhancing efficiency.
Efforts to align textbooks with the National Curriculum Framework continue, with competency-based textbooks now available for seven out of 15 grades. NCERT is expanding its annual printing capacity, from 5 crore to 15 crore textbooks, to keep up with growing demand.
The government has enhanced the PM POSHAN scheme. Between 2014 and 2024, the central government allocated over ₹1.04 lakh crore to support mid-day meals in schools, compared to ₹71,525 crore allocated in the previous decade. Meal costs were revised in December 2024, increasing to ₹6.19 for primary and Balvatika classes and ₹9.29 for upper primary classes.
To further improve learning outcomes, the government has set up 32 Vidya Samiksha Kendras, with 24 integrated into the Rashtriya VSK at NCERT. The PARAKH Rashtriya Sarvekshan, an assessment of learning outcomes, was conducted in December 2024, covering 23 lakh students across over 87,000 schools.

Title: Austrian far right to lead state government in Styria for first time
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 16:50:16 +0000
Content: Austria’s far-right Freedom Party, which won a state election in Styria last month, announced a coalition deal on Tuesday that will make its leader there governor of the southern state.
It is the first time one of Austria’s nine states will be led by the eurosceptic, Russia-friendly Freedom Party (FPO) since its charismatic then-leader Joerg Haider was governor of Carinthia in the 2000s.
The three weeks it took to reach a coalition deal contrasts with national coalition talks that are still ongoing following the country’s general election on Sept. 29. The resurgent FPO has not been invited to join those talks despite coming top in the general election.
Mario Kunasek, the party’s leader in Styria, told a news conference the FPO and its future coalition partner, the conservative People’s party (OVP), had shown an ability to listen to each other and overcome their differences that “distinguishes us in our political culture from others”.
That was an apparent swipe at OVP Chancellor Karl Nehammer, who before and after September’s general election ruled out going into government with FPO leader Herbert Kickl.
The FPO secured about 29% of the national vote and would have needed a coalition partner to form a government. Since all other parliamentary parties ruled out governing with it, President Alexander Van der Bellen tasked Nehammer with forming a government. He is in coalition talks with two other parties.
Kunasek outlined some plans for Styria, ranging from local issues such as hospital provision to measures targeting “Islamism” which include a ban on religious clothing for state administration employees.

Title: New HIV prevention drug could reach poorest countries by 2025, says health official
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 16:30:25 +0000
Content: A new long-acting preventive HIV drug could reach the world’s poorest countries by the end of 2025 or early 2026, a global health official told Reuters on Tuesday.
The ambition is to start deliveries of Gilead Sciences’ lenacapavir on that timeline, said Hui Yang, head of supply operations at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. However, she said a lot of things need to happen first, including the injectable drug receiving regulatory approvals from authorities like the United States Food and Drug Administration and the World Health Organization.
Lenacapavir is already approved for use as a treatment for multi-drug resistant HIV, costing around $42,250 for the first year of therapy in the United States. Clinical trials this year showed it is also very effective at preventing infection and Gilead is seeking approvals for the new use globally.
“We don’t want…low and low-middle income countries to wait, to be at the back of the line,” when these approvals come in, said Yang, an equality issue that has plagued the fight against HIV for decades.
To avoid this, the Global Fund said on Tuesday it would join forces with the United States President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), with funding from the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to support affordable access to the pricey drug in countries they work with “from day one”.
The groups did not provide further details on how this may work, other than saying they aimed to reach at least two million people over three years.
Gilead signed deals in October this year with six generic drugmakers to make and sell lenacapavir more cheaply in 120 low and middle-income countries. The move was criticized for leaving out countries, especially in Latin America.
No deal has yet been signed with Gilead or any of these generic producers, Yang said, but they will work with all the companies involved.
Gilead’s chief executive and chairman Daniel O’Day said the initiative would help accelerate access so more people could access lenacapavir from the outset.

Title: Sri Lanka can produce surplus energy, open to exporting to India: Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 15:56:40 +0000
Content: Sri Lanka has the potential to produce surplus energy and could export it to India and other neighbouring nations if new energy projects are initiated, Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath said on Tuesday.
Speaking at the India Foundation Programme, Herath invited Indian companies to participate in the development of Sri Lanka’s energy sector. He said that while some energy projects are already underway, discussions are ongoing for others.
On India’s role in Sri Lanka’s energy security, Herath said, “We have surplus energy power, we have wind power and solar power. If we can start new energy projects, we can export to India and all other neighbouring countries because we have the ability to produce surplus energy. Therefore, we are in stand with the support of your companies (the Indian companies) to develop our energy sector.”
He further added that proposals and projects are currently being discussed for regions like Sampur, Mannar, and Jaffna. Herath said, “There are so many proposals out there, and we have already started some projects. We are talking with some projects because there are some technical issues in Sampur, Mannar and Jaffna. There are so many projects and proposals. Therefore, we need to finalise within a short period, and then after that, we can start those projects. After succeeding in those projects, I think, as a country we can share our energy with our neighbouring countries also. In that scenario, those projects are very valuable.”
On bilateral ties, Herath pointed to the strong relationship between India and Sri Lanka, highlighting Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake’s ongoing visit to India as a reflection of their shared ties.
“The current visit to India of President Anura Kumara Dissanayake is his first visit and symbolizes the closely knit bilateral ties which our nations share. India-Sri Lanka relations are founded on historical, civilizational, religious and cultural bonds. These bonds go back to time immemorial, more than 2500 years the least,” Herath said.
He elaborated on the cultural and religious links between the two nations, noting the role of Buddhism and Hinduism. “India had given us the gift of Buddhism, which gave rise to a flourishing Buddhist civilization in the island more than two millennia ago, and the influence of Hinduism was built into our socio-cultural fabric over the centuries of movement of people and interactions. Along with these religions, literature, languages, architecture, sculpture and agrarian economy, etc. developed in Sri Lanka.”
Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake held a meeting at Hyderabad House in Delhi on Monday.

Title: NTA to focus only on entrance exams for higher education, says Dharmendra Pradhan
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 14:32:22 +0000
Content: The National Testing Agency (NTA) will conduct only entrance exams for higher education institutions from 2025, Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said on Tuesday. He clarified that NTA will no longer conduct recruitment examinations.
 
“We are working towards technology-driven entrance exams that ensure zero error and minimize irregularities,” Pradhan said while addressing reporters at his residence. 
 
He also announced the restructuring of NTA to improve its efficiency and credibility. “We have started the process of restructuring the NTA by creating new posts and appointing new officers. This will bring fresh energy into the organization,” he added.
 
The restructuring follows recommendations from a high-level committee led by former ISRO Chairman Dr. K. Radhakrishnan. The committee, formed in June after the NEET-undergraduate paper leak, submitted its report to the Ministry of Education on October 21.
 
The committee, constituted on June 22, held around 30 meetings and proposed 101 recommendations to ensure the fair and smooth conduct of examinations. 
 
The committee also proposed the creation of a Grievance Reporting and Redressal Cell (GRRC) to address issues faced by students during exams. “Given the scale of exams like JEE and NEET, which see participation from millions of students, this is a critical step,” Pradhan said.
 
Addressing student concerns, Pradhan stressed the need for measures to tackle mental health challenges and ensure timely declaration of results. He said, “Mental health will be a focus.”
 
On the issue of exam security, Pradhan pointed out that robust cybersecurity measures were necessary. The committee proposed dynamic solutions to secure question papers and prevent irregularities.
 
The reforms also include simplifying the admission process under the Common University Entrance Test (CUET) and regulating coaching centers to address their commercialization. “We want to ensure coaching centers are not misused by market forces,” he added.
 
To facilitate the reforms, the committee suggested leveraging public testing infrastructure, such as schools and local colleges, and engaging in continuous research on psychometrics.
 
Dr. Radhakrishnan has been requested to lead a three-member high-power steering committee to oversee these changes.
 
Starting in 2025, entrance exams will take place earlier in the academic year, moving from the usual July timeline to January or February. Pradhan clarified that while the Health Ministry will determine how exams like NEET are conducted, the NTA, as a service provider, will focus on zero-error execution.
 
The committee’s establishment followed the NEET-UG paper leak, which led to a CBI investigation that identified 144 candidates who allegedly paid to access leaked and solved exam papers. This scandal, coupled with the cancellation or postponement of exams like UGC-NET, prompted widespread criticism and demands for reforms.
 
“We have taken extensive feedback from parents, technologists, state administrators, and cybersecurity experts. This is a collective effort to make the examination system more robust and student-friendly,” Pradhan concluded.

Title: Combined liver, kidney transplant successfully done on 54-year-old man in Hyderabad
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 13:14:20 +0000
Content: Star Hospitals has successfully performed a simultaneous liver and kidney transplant on a 54-year-old critically ill patient, Rama Rao, a businessman from Ongole, Andhra Pradesh.  
 
The patient suffered from liver and kidney failure, compounded by multiple comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, and hepatitis B infection. Diagnosed with liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, his condition worsened over time, leading to water retention in the body (ascites) and kidney failure, further complicating his health.  
 
Admitted to Star Hospitals’ Hepatology and Liver Transplant department, he presented with severe infection, low blood pressure, hepatic coma, and toxin accumulation in the blood due to combined liver and kidney failure. With less than a 10% chance of survival in such cases, stabilising the patient in the ICU and performing an urgent simultaneous liver and kidney transplant was critical.  
 
This extraordinary feat was made possible by the patient’s family, who demonstrated remarkable selflessness. The patient’s spouse donated a kidney, while his son donated a portion of his liver.  
 
The complex 12-hour surgery involved simultaneous operations on both donors and the patient in adjacent operating theatres. Both donors were discharged within a week in excellent condition, while the patient experienced a smooth recovery, marking a new lease on life.  
 
Dr. Mettu Srinivas Reddy, Director and Lead Surgeon at Star Liver Institute, highlighted the case’s complexity: “Multi-organ transplantation is a highly challenging procedure, especially for critically ill patients. Successfully conducting such a surgery using two family donors demands exceptional technical expertise and coordination. Our interdisciplinary team of over 50 specialists worked seamlessly to ensure success.”  
 
Dr. Golamari Srinivasa Reddy, Clinical Lead Consultant for Hepatology and Transplant Hepatology, explained the challenges in managing the patient: “Severe liver cirrhosis and kidney failure, especially when complicated by infection, can be fatal without immediate treatment. This case underlines the importance of specialised liver intensive care and screening for hepatitis B to prevent such conditions.”  
 
Dr. Sridhar, Director of Nephrology and Renal Transplant, emphasised the need for a kidney transplant: “With the patient’s kidney function severely impaired, a kidney transplant was vital. Without it, he would have required frequent dialysis, even post-liver transplant. A simultaneous procedure was crucial for sustainable recovery.”  
 
Dr. Ravindranath, Chief Mentor at Star Liver Institute, lauded the hospital’s capabilities: “This successful multi-organ transplant showcases the unmatched expertise of our medical team and our advanced facilities, making Star Hospitals a preferred destination for complex healthcare needs.

Title: Over 57,000 sewer and septic tank workers identified under NAMASTE scheme
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 12:18:06 +0000
Content: The National Action for Mechanised Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) scheme has profiled over 57,758 Sewer and Septic Tank Workers (SSWs) across India, with 54,574 workers validated so far, Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment, Ramdas Athawale, informed the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.
The initiative, launched in the 2023-24 fiscal year, seeks to ensure safety, dignity, and socio-economic empowerment for sanitation workers. It is being implemented across more than 4,800 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) under a collaboration between the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJ&E) and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).
The data reveals that sanitation work remains deeply entrenched in social inequalities, with 67.91% of the workers coming from Scheduled Castes (SC), followed by 15.73% from Other Backward Classes (OBC), 8.31% from Scheduled Tribes (ST), and 8.05% from the General category.
Over 16,791 Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits and 43 safety devices kits for Emergency Response Sanitation Units (ERSUs) have been distributed to improve worker safety. Health benefits have been extended to 13,604 workers and their families through Ayushman cards. A capital subsidy of Rs. 13.96 crore has been granted to 503 sanitation workers and dependents for sanitation-related projects. Additionally, Rs. 2.85 crore has been disbursed to 226 workers for alternative self-employment opportunities. 837 workshops have been conducted across municipalities to raise awareness of safe sanitation practices and to train workers on preventing hazardous cleaning methods.
To eradicate unsafe manual cleaning practices, the government has focused on mechanization. Under the Swachh Bharat Mission-Urban 2.0 (SBM-U 2.0), Rs. 371 crore has been allocated to 26 states and Union Territories for procuring 2,585 desludging vehicles. This mechanization is expected to reduce health hazards and improve efficiency in sanitation work.
Furthermore, guidelines have been issued by MoHUA to all states and UTs, emphasizing strict safety procedures, the establishment of ERSUs, and the use of modern equipment for sewer and septic tank cleaning.
The integration of data from states like Tamil Nadu and Odisha into the central NAMASTE database is currently underway to ensure a more comprehensive outreach. The government is actively working to expand the scheme’s benefits to all sanitation workers nationwide.

Title: Western governments expand contacts with Syria’s new leadership
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 12:10:20 +0000
Content: German and French officials are due to meet representatives of Syria’s new governing authorities in Damascus on Tuesday, expanding Western contacts with the new administration after British diplomats met its leader Ahmed al-Sharaa late on Monday.
Nine days after Bashar al-Assad was ousted, the new prime minister installed by Sharaa’s Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group said the government was grappling with very low currency reserves and called for sanctions to be lifted.
Western states are gradually opening channels to the new authorities in Damascus led by HTS, though they continue to designate it as a terrorist group.
Late on Monday, Sharaa, formerly known by his nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani, met a British foreign ministry delegation. He stressed the need for the restoration of ties and lifting sanctions on Syria so that Syrian refugees can return home, the Syrian state news agency SANA reported.
Photos published by SANA showed Sharaa, whose group was part of al Qaeda until he broke ties in 2016, sitting in a suit with an open shirt during the meeting, his highest level encounter yet with a Western government official since HTS seized power.
The images underline the geopolitical shift since Assad was toppled by HTS-led forces, a blow to Assad’s Russian and Iranian allies which could potentially open the way for Western states to reopen contacts with Damascus.
But for now at least, any Western overtures require manoeuvring around both the terrorism designation imposed on HTS during its days as an al Qaeda affiliate and financial sanctions imposed on Damascus under Assad.
Sharaa “spoke about the need to build a state of law and institutions, and establishing security,” SANA reported. “He also spoke about Britain’s important role internationally.”
Ahead of the meeting, British foreign minister David Lammy said London had sent a delegation of senior officials to Damascus to meet with the new interim Syrian authorities and civil society groups.
German diplomats are also planning talks with representatives of HTS in Damascus on Tuesday, the German foreign ministry said.
A German foreign ministry spokesperson said the talks would focus on a transitional process for Syria and the protection of minorities.
“The possibilities of a diplomatic presence in Damascus are also being explored there,” the spokesperson added in a statement, reiterating that Berlin was monitoring HTS closely in light of its roots in al Qaeda ideology.
“As far as one can tell, they have acted prudently so far,” the spokesperson said.
The new administration in Damascus has set out few details on its thinking for the next steps, even as it has swiftly established control over state institutions.
The justice of Islam
In an interview with Al Jazeera Mubasher, the newly installed Prime Minister Mohammed al-Bashir said the defence ministry would be restructured using using former rebel factions and officers who defected from Assad’s army.
Asked what he would say to those worried about a single religious or political group dominating Syria, Bashir said: “Those who are afraid…of a religion trend or anything else doesn’t truly understand Islam, the forgiveness of Islam, the justice of Islam”.
“Syria is for all Syrians,” he said. “Everyone is a partner for us building the Syria of the future.”
Bashir, who formerly led an HTS-affiliated government in Idlib province, has said he will remain in office until March.
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on Monday the European Union should be ready to ease sanctions on Syria if the country’s new leadership takes “positive steps” to establish an inclusive government and respect women’s and minority rights.
The Syrian conflict, which spiralled out of 2011 uprising against Assad’s repressive rule, drove millions of Syrians abroad as refugees, including around 1 million who went to Germany.
French diplomats are also expected to visit Damascus later on Tuesday to meet HTS representatives, French officials said.
The U.S. State Department said on Monday that the U.S. government has had more than one communication with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) over the past week.

Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:56:30 +0000
Content: South Korean investigators probing President Yoon Suk Yeol’s short-lived martial law declaration failed to gain entry to his office to seek evidence on Tuesday after presidential office security staff denied them entry, Yonhap news agency reported.
Yoon was impeached on Saturday over his martial law decree and suspended from his presidential duties. Yonhap said that investigators looking for evidence about the legality of Yoon’s martial law decision waited for about seven hours to be let in, but the presidential office security service denied them entry.
A joint investigation team including police and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO) was trying to access computer servers of the presidential office’s security service to get records of phones including one used by the police commissioner, Yonhap said, citing the team.
This would be the second time authorities have tried and failed to raid the presidential office over the declaration of martial law that was reversed within hours after a standoff with parliament.
An attempt on Dec. 11 ended without entry, but the presidential office voluntarily submitted some data.
The presidential office’s security service said it would express its position on Wednesday concerning cooperation with raids, Yonhap reported.
The police and the presidential office did not have an immediate comment on Tuesday. The CIO declined to comment.
Since his last public remarks shortly after he was impeached by parliament in a vote on Saturday, Yoon has kept a low profile and authorities and the Constitutional Court have not been able to contact or summon him, according to the court and officials.
Yoon has been putting together legal teams to defend himself against accusations of insurrection and in the Constitutional Court case which will decide whether to remove him from office or restore his powers.
Seok Dong-Hyun, a lawyer and an ex-prosecutor who helps Yoon, told reporters on Tuesday that the president’s declaration of martial law did not constitute insurrection, Yonhap reported.
Yoon would also “confidently express his position in the (Constitutional) Court”, Yonhap cited Seok as saying.
Seok declined to say whether Yoon would comply with a summons to appear for questioning on Dec. 21, and said authorities needed to streamline current investigations being conducted by several agencies at once, including the prosecution, the police and the CIO, Yonhap reported.
Seok could not immediately be reached for comment by Reuters.
Meanwhile, South Korea’s acting president Han Duck-soo on Tuesday called during a cabinet meeting for next year’s government budget to be swiftly implemented from the start of 2025 in order to help revive the country’s slowing economy.
Han has been working to reassure South Korea’s allies and calm financial markets since taking over the duties of Yoon after the president was impeached.
The government has decided to frontload 75% of its 2025 budget to be implemented during the first half of the year, the finance ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.
South Korea faces economic challenges, including heightened uncertainty for the trade-dependent country created by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s pledge to hike tariffs, as export growth in Asia’s fourth-largest economy slowed for a fourth-straight month in November, to the weakest level in 14 months.
The foreign ministry said in a statement on Tuesday it launched a task force to respond to the new Trump administration’s foreign policies.

Title: Mayotte authorities fear hunger, disease after cyclone; death toll rises in Mozambique
Publication Date: Tue, 17 Dec 2024 11:36:00 +0000
Content: Authorities in Mayotte were racing on Tuesday to stop hunger, disease and lawlessness from spreading in the French overseas territory after the weekend’s devastating cyclone, while Mozambique reported dozens of deaths from the storm.
Hundreds or even thousands could be dead in Mayotte, which took the strongest hit from Cyclone Chido, French officials have said. The storm laid waste to large parts of the archipelago off east Africa, France’s poorest overseas territory, before striking continental Africa.
With many parts of Mayotte still inaccessible and some victims buried before their deaths could be officially counted, it may take days to discover the full extent of the destruction.
So far, 22 deaths and more than 1,400 injuries have been confirmed, Ambdilwahedou Soumaila, the mayor of the capital Mamoudzou, told Radio France Internationale on Tuesday morning.
“The priority today is water and food,” Soumaila said. “There are people who have unfortunately died where the bodies are starting to decompose that can create a sanitary problem.”
“We don’t have electricity. When night falls, there are people who take advantage of that situation.”
Twenty tonnes of food and water are due to start arriving on Tuesday by air and sea. The French government said late on Monday it expects 50% of water supplies to be restored within 48 hours and 95% within the week.
France’s interior ministry announced that a curfew would go into effect on Tuesday night from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. local time.
Rescue workers have been searching for survivors amid the debris of shantytowns bowled over by 200 kph (124 mph) winds.
Chido was the strongest storm to strike Mayotte in more than 90 years, French weather service Meteo France said. In Mozambique, it killed at least 34 people, officials said on Tuesday. Another seven died in Malawi.
Drone footage from Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado province, already experiencing a humanitarian crisis due to an Islamist insurgency, showed razed thatched-roof houses near the beach and personal belongings scattered under the few palm trees still standing.
Illegal Immigration
French President Emmanuel Macron said after an emergency cabinet meeting on Monday that he would visit Mayotte in the coming days, as the disaster quickly fuelled a political back-and-forth about immigration, the environment and France’s treatment of its overseas territories.
Mayotte has been grappling with unrest in recent years, with many residents angry at illegal immigration and inflation.
More than three-quarters of its roughly 321,000 people live in relative poverty, and about one-third are estimated to be undocumented migrants, most from nearby Comoros and Madagascar.
The territory has become a stronghold for the far-right National Rally with 60% voting for Marine Le Pen in the 2022 presidential election runoff.
France’s acting Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, from the conservative Republicans party, told a news conference in Mayotte that the early warning system had worked “perfectly” but many of the undocumented had not come to designated shelters.
Other officials have said undocumented migrants may have been afraid to go to shelters for fear of being arrested.
The toll of the cyclone, Retailleau said in a later post on X, underscored the need to address “the migration question”.
“Mayotte is the symbol of the drift that (French) governments have allowed to take hold on this issue,” he said. “We will need to legislate so that in Mayotte, like everywhere else on the national territory, France retakes control of its immigration.”
Left-wing politicians, however, have pointed the finger at what they say is the government’s neglect of Mayotte and failure to prepare for natural disasters linked to climate change.
Socialist Party chairman Olivier Faure blasted Retailleau’s comments in an X post.
“He could have interrogated the role of climate change in producing more and more intense climate disasters. He could have rallied against the extreme poverty that makes people more vulnerable to cyclones,” said Faure.
“No, he has resumed his crusade against migrants.”
Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, appointed last week to steer France out of a political crisis, faced criticism after he went to the town of Pau, where he is the mayor, to attend a municipal council meeting on Monday, instead of visiting Mayotte.

Title: Indian spin legend Ashwin hangs up his boots from international cricket
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 07:01:55 +0000
Content: By: Aditya Ahuja
India’s spin maestro, Ravichandran Ashwin, announced his retirement from international cricket across all formats after the third Test against Australia in Brisbane ended in a draw on Wednesday.
Ashwin, one of India’s most successful bowlers, retires with an impressive 537 wickets from 106 Test matches, making him the second-highest wicket-taker among Indian bowlers, behind only Anil Kumble, who has 619 wickets.
Although Ashwin was not selected for the opening Test in Perth, he made a return to the team for the day-night second Test in Adelaide, where he took a solitary wicket. That match ultimately proved to be his final Test appearance after he was omitted from the lineup for the Brisbane game.
“This will be my last day as an Indian cricketer in all formats at the international level,” the 38-year-old Ashwin said, addressing the media at the Gabba. “I do feel there’s a bit of punch left in me as a cricketer, but I would like to showcase that at the club level.”
Ashwin, who has been a key figure in India’s success over the years, expressed his gratitude for the memories created alongside teammates, including India captain Rohit Sharma. “I had a lot of fun. I must say, I created a lot of memories alongside Rohit and several of my other teammates,” he added, with Sharma standing by his side.
Apart from his remarkable Test career, Ashwin has also played 116 One-Day Internationals (ODIs) and 65 Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is), taking a total of 765 wickets across all formats.
Known for his skillful off-spin, Ashwin was a match-winner on India’s turning tracks and also emerged as a reliable Test all-rounder, scoring six centuries in the format.

Title: INS Nirdeshak to be commissioned in Visakhapatnam
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 07:01:13 +0000
Content: The Indian Navy is set to welcome its newest vessel, INS Nirdeshak, in a commissioning ceremony on Wednesday at the Naval Dockyard in Visakhapatnam. The event will be presided over by Minister of State for Defence Sanjay Seth.
According to the Ministry of Defence, INS Nirdeshak is the second ship under the Survey Vessel (Large) Project, constructed at Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) in Kolkata. Notably, over 80% of the vessel’s components are indigenously produced, reinforcing India’s commitment to self-reliance in defence manufacturing.
The ship pays tribute to its predecessor, the original Nirdeshak, which served the Indian Navy for 32 years before being decommissioned in 2014. The new vessel is designed to carry forward the legacy, boasting advanced operational capabilities, including an endurance of 25 days at sea and a top speed exceeding 18 knots.
The Ministry of Defence highlighted that the commissioning of INS Nirdeshak is a significant step in modernising the Indian Navy’s hydrographic fleet. The ship will also bolster the nation’s SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) initiative, aligning with India’s strategic focus on regional security and scientific exploration.
The ceremony will be hosted by Vice Admiral Rajesh Pendharkar, Flag Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Eastern Naval Command, and will be attended by senior naval officials, representatives from GRSE, and other dignitaries.

Title: Regulating OTTs comes under preview of I&B ministry, concerns of Telecom Service Providers have been raised: Jyotiraditya Scindia
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 06:56:01 +0000
Content: The regulation of over-the-top (OTT) platforms falls under the jurisdiction of the Information and Broadcasting (I&B) Ministry, Union Minister for Communications Jyotiraditya Scindia said in an interview with ANI. Scindia also said that one of the six advisory groups he established had flagged concerns regarding OTT platforms, particularly from the perspective of Telecom Service Providers (TSPs).
Scindia said, “That is something that, to be very candid, comes under the domain of the Ministry of I&B. Having said that, I have six advisory groups that I have set up and this concept has come up as an issue that they would like to discuss from the point of view of the TSPs.”
The ongoing debate centers around the idea of OTT platforms sharing the costs incurred by TSPs in delivering content to consumers. TSPs argue that such cost-sharing arrangements could help finance necessary investments in expanding network infrastructure. On the other hand, critics warn that such measures may violate the principles of net neutrality, which mandates equal treatment of all internet traffic.
Net neutrality prohibits content providers from making payments to TSPs, arguing that introducing such payments could enable network operators to prioritize specific platforms, undermining the internet’s open and democratic nature. Critics stress that such practices could disproportionately benefit larger platforms and harm smaller players in the digital ecosystem.
Proponents of cost-sharing, however, point to the rapid evolution of the digital economy and telecom sector. From 2015 to 2023, India witnessed an exponential increase in mobile data consumption, with average usage per user rising from 0.09 GB to 17.36 GB per month. Despite this surge, network infrastructure has struggled to keep up. Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and the Internet of Things (IoT) are expected to further drive up data usage, increasing the demand for network upgrades.
Advocates for cost-sharing argue that the current net neutrality framework may no longer be adequate to address these evolving challenges. They propose a more nuanced approach that balances the interests of all stakeholders involved. For example, larger OTT platforms with significant revenue streams, such as subscription fees and advertising, could be required to contribute to network costs, while smaller or less profitable platforms might be exempt in order to foster innovation and competition.
Furthermore, any new framework would need to address potential contractual disputes between TSPs and OTT platforms, as well as safeguard against monopolistic practices that could harm smaller players in the market.
One proposed solution to these challenges is extending the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India’s (TRAI) interconnection regulations to OTT platforms. This would create clear rules for how OTTs and TSPs interact, ensuring transparency and fairness while preserving net neutrality principles related to quality of service.

Title: India finish on high note as rain ensures Gabba Test ends in stalemate
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 06:26:45 +0000
Content: India may thank the heavens after rain cut short Australia’s push for victory on the final day of the third test in Brisbane on Wednesday, raising the stakes for Melbourne where the series shifts for the traditional ‘Boxing Day’ clash.
India were eight for no loss when tea was called early due to failing light at the Gabba, with the tourists needing 267 runs for victory.
With a heavy downpour preventing the resumption of play after the break, the match was abandoned and the series remains locked at 1-1.
“We’ll take that, obviously,” said India captain Rohit Sharma at the post-match presentation.
“We head to Melbourne with the confidence that we can try to pull things toward us.”
Captain Pat Cummins had declared Australia’s second innings closed at 89 for seven to give India an improbable 275-run victory target as dark clouds gathered near the ground.
Cummins and fellow pacer Mitchell Starc bowled only 2.1 overs at the Indian openers before play was halted.
Yashasvi Jaiswal was four not out, with KL Rahul also on four.
“Unfortunately a lot of rain, which you can’t do anything about… I’m really proud of how the guys played,” said Cummins.
“We were right ahead of the game…. We just about ticked off every box we could.”
Australia bowled out India for 260 after scoring a first innings 445, with rain blighting the match throughout.
After capturing India’s final wicket in the first hour on day five, Australia led by 185 runs but rain denied them the chance to bat until after lunch.
In search of quick runs, Australia crashed to 33 for five as Akash Deep and Jasprit Bumrah removed the top four for single-digit scores, a day after the pacemen combined in a brave 10th-wicket partnership to ensure India would avoid the follow-on.
Travis Head and Alex Carey (19 not out) briefly stemmed the bleeding with a 27-run partnership before Head top-edged Mohammed Siraj to be out for 17.
Cummins slogged 22 off 10 balls before becoming Bumrah’s third wicket and declared five balls later.
Australia’s hopes of forcing a result were always hostage to the weather but their chances of victory were already wafer-thin given their attack was a man down.
Pace stalwart Josh Hazlewood was out of action after succumbing to a calf injury, while there were also concerns about all-rounder Mitchell Marsh’s fitness after he bowled only two overs in the match.
Travis Head was named Player of the Match after scoring 152 in Australia’s first innings, having also scored a big hundred in the hosts’ second test win in Adelaide.

Title: India unveils Kisan Kavach: Revolutionary anti-pesticide suit to safeguard farmers
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 06:22:03 +0000
Content: Union Minister Jitendra Singh on Tuesday launched Kisan Kavach, India’s first indigenous anti-pesticide bodysuit, designed to protect farmers from harmful pesticide exposure. This innovative suit aims to significantly improve farmer safety and marks a major advancement in agricultural and health technology.
Developed by BRIC-inStem, Bengaluru, in collaboration with Sepio Health Pvt. Ltd., Kisan Kavach uses advanced fabric technology to neutralize harmful pesticides on contact. It provides protection against pesticide-induced toxicity, which can cause serious health problems such as respiratory disorders, vision impairment, and fatalities.
Singh described the suit as a crucial step toward safeguarding farmers’ health and praised the Department of Biotechnology and BRIC-inStem for their efforts in developing this project. The suit aligns with the government’s vision of leveraging technology to support farmers and strengthen the agricultural sector.
The suit is washable, reusable, and priced at ₹4,000. It is designed to last up to a year and utilizes nucleophile-based fabric technology to deactivate pesticides, as detailed in a report published in Nature Communications. Its production involves attaching nucleophilic molecules to cotton fabric to create a durable protective layer.
During the launch event, the first batch of Kisan Kavach suits was distributed to farmers. Singh emphasized that scaled-up production would make the suits more affordable and accessible to farmers across the country.
Given that a large portion of India’s population depends on agriculture, Kisan Kavach is expected to make a transformative impact. Singh also highlighted the government’s commitment to integrating innovation into agriculture, citing the BioE3 biomanufacturing initiative and the growth of over 8,500 biotech startups as key examples.

Title: Japan’s Space One Kairos rocket fails minutes after liftoff
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 05:54:47 +0000
Content: Japan’s Space One terminated the flight of its Kairos small rocket shortly after liftoff on Wednesday, marking the end of its second attempt in nine months to become the country’s first company to deliver a satellite to space.
It is the latest in a series of recent setbacks for Japanese rocket development, even as the government looks to boost the domestic space industry and is targeting 30 rocket launches annually by the early 2030s.
Authorities are pushing to make Japan Asia’s space transportation hub in what they hope will be an 8 trillion yen ($52 billion) space industry.
The second Kairos flight, which only lasted about 10 minutes, was terminated because “the achievement of its mission would be difficult”, Space One said in an email to reporters.
Live images from the local Wakayama prefecture government showed the 18-metre (59 ft) solid-propellant rocket blasting off from Spaceport Kii in western Japan at 11:00 a.m. (0200 GMT) but losing stability in its trajectory as it ascended.
Five small satellites, including one from the Taiwan Space Agency, were on board the rocket headed into sun-synchronous orbit roughly 500 km (311 miles) above the Earth’s surface.
Space One is investigating the incident and will host a press conference at 2:30 p.m. local time, the company said.
Tokyo-based Space One was founded in 2018 by Canon Electronics, T aerospace unit, construction firm Shimizu and a state-backed bank, with the goal of launching 20 small rockets a year by 2029 to capture growing satellite launch demand.
At its debut flight in March, Kairos, carrying a Japanese government satellite,exploded five seconds after launch.
Inappropriate flight settings triggered the rocket’s autonomous self-destruct system even though no issues were found in its hardware, Space One later said.
A lack of domestic launch options has seen emerging Japanese space startups such as radar satellite maker iQPS and debris mitigator Astroscale tapping on SpaceX’s rideshare missions or leading small rocket provider Rocket Lab.
Recent Japanese rocket projects have also faced other setbacks.
The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) postponed the debut flight of the new solid-fuel launcher Epsilon S after its engine combustion test failed last month for a second time.
JAXA’s larger liquid-propellant rocket H3 also failed at its inaugural launch in March 2023 but has succeeded in three flights this year, winning orders from clients such as French satellite giant Eutelsat.
In 2019, Interstellar Technologies became the first Japanese firm to send a rocket into space without a satellite payload, but its orbital launcher Zero is still under development.

Title: Gaza ceasefire talks gain momentum as officials push for deal
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 05:16:02 +0000
Content: An agreement to halt the 14-month-old war in Gaza and free hostages held in the Palestinian enclave could be signed in the coming days with talks in Cairo making progress, sources briefed on the meeting said on Tuesday.
The U.S. administration, joined by mediators from Egypt and Qatar, has made intensive efforts in recent days to advance the talks before President Joe Biden leaves office next month.
“We believe – and the Israelis have said this – that we’re getting closer, and no doubt about it, we believe that, but we also are cautious in our optimism,” White House spokesperson John Kirby said in an interview with Fox News.
“We’ve been in this position before where we weren’t able to get it over the finish line.”
The sources said a ceasefire deal could be days away that would stop the fighting and return hostages held by the Islamist movement Hamas in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails.
CIA Director William Burns, a key U.S. negotiator, was due in Doha on Wednesday for talks with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani on bridging remaining gaps between Israel and Hamas, other knowledgeable sources told Reuters.
The CIA declined to comment.
Hamas said in a statement a deal was possible if Israel stopped setting new conditions. A Palestinian official close to the mediation efforts said negotiations were serious, with discussions under way about every word.
Sources briefed on the meeting said Netanyahu was on his way to Cairo, but a statement from Netanyahu’s office said he had a meeting on Tuesday with senior military and security officials on Mount Hermon, a strategic plateau just inside Syria.
Separately, his spokesperson messaged Israeli correspondents to say: “The prime minister is not in Cairo.”
Two Egyptian security sources said that Netanyahu was not in Cairo “at this moment” but that a meeting was under way to work through the remaining points, chief among them a Hamas demand for guarantees that any immediate deal would lead to a comprehensive agreement later.
The Egyptian sources said they were making progress and felt that Tuesday night could be decisive in setting the next steps.
Netanyahu had been excused on Tuesday from giving previously scheduled testimony at his corruption trial. He met in Israel on Monday with Adam Boehler, designated by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to be his special envoy for hostage affairs.
At a press conference in Florida on Monday, Trump reiterated his threat that “all hell is going to break out” if Hamas does not release its hostages by Jan. 20, the day he takes office.
Later, Trump said that if no ceasefire deal is reached by the time he takes office, “It’s not going to be pleasant.” He did not elaborate.
U.S. and Israeli officials have expressed growing optimism that negotiations brokered by Egypt and Qatar could produce a deal by the end of the month but have also cautioned that the talks could fall through.
Israeli negotiators were in Doha on Monday looking to bridge gaps between Israel and Hamas on a deal Biden outlined in May.
There have been repeated rounds of talks over the past year, all of which have ended in failure, with Israel insisting on retaining a military presence in Gaza and Hamas refusing to release hostages until the troops pulled out.
The war in Gaza, triggered by a Hamas-led attack on communities in southern Israel that killed some 1,200 people and saw more than 250 abducted as hostages, has sent shockwaves across the Middle East and left Israel isolated internationally.
Israel’s campaign has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, displaced most of the 2.3 million population and reduced much of the coastal enclave to ruins.
Israeli airstrikes killed extended families in homes in two parts of the northern Gaza Strip on Tuesday, medics said.
At least 10 people were confirmed killed in an airstrike on a house in Gaza City that destroyed the building, while further north in the town of Beit Lahiya at least 15 people were believed to be dead or missing under the rubble of a house hit around dawn.

Title: French President Macron thanks PM Modi for India’s support after Cyclone Chido hits Mayotte
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 04:58:41 +0000
Content: French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his gratitude to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday after India extended support in the aftermath of cyclone Chido, a devastating storm that struck the French archipelago of Mayotte on Saturday.
According to Meteo-France, Cyclone Chido is the strongest storm to hit Mayotte in over 90 years. The catastrophic winds flattened entire neighborhoods, destroyed electrical grids, and severely damaged critical infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, and the airport’s control tower.
Prime Minister Modi had earlier expressed his condolences, saying, “Deeply saddened by the devastation caused by Cyclone Chido in Mayotte. My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families. I am confident that under President Emmanuel Macron’s leadership, France will overcome this tragedy with resilience and resolve. India stands in solidarity with France and is ready to extend all possible assistance.”
Responding to PM Modi’s message, President Macron said, “Thank you for your thoughts and support, dear Narendra Modi.”
Cyclone Chido, a Category 4 storm, caused extensive damage as it swept through the southwestern Indian Ocean over the weekend. The cyclone first impacted northern Madagascar before intensifying rapidly and making landfall in Mayotte, with wind speeds exceeding 220 km/h (136 mph).
The storm, which affected the archipelago of over 300,000 residents, continued its destructive path into northern Mozambique, where it caused further damage before gradually weakening.
French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou commented during an inter-ministerial meeting, “Everyone understands that this was an unexpectedly violent cyclone.”
The toll from the storm has been staggering, with officials fearing fatalities could reach the thousands. Prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville stated, “I think there will definitely be several hundred, perhaps we will come close to a thousand or even several thousand deaths,” as reported by broadcaster Mayotte la Premiere.
Initial reports confirmed at least 11 deaths, but the numbers are expected to rise as rescue efforts continue.
The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) expressed concern on Tuesday about more than 200 of its volunteers feared missing in Mayotte after Cyclone Chido devastated the islands.
“Winds of up to 220 km/h caused by Cyclone Chido have devastated the French overseas territory of Mayotte. It’s feared that more than 200 … volunteers are missing,” the IFRC said on X.

Title: 28 indian fishermen return home after repatriation from Bahrain
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 13:28:45 +0000
Content: The Indian Embassy in Bahrain has announced the repatriation of 28 Indian fishermen who were recently detained in the country. The fishermen, initially sentenced to six months in prison, had their terms reduced to three months, allowing for their earlier release.
The embassy, in a post on X, shared the update, saying, “India in Bahrain is pleased to announce repatriation of 28 Indian fishermen who were recently freed after reduction in sentence from 6 to 3 months. The embassy facilitated legal assistance and travel under GoI’s Indian Community Welfare Fund. Well-being of Indian nationals is our priority.”
The Indian Embassy also thanked the Bahraini authorities for “cooperation.” In another post on X, it wrote, “We thank the Bahraini authorities for cooperation & swift response including for providing consular access. Wishing them a safe return to their families in India.”
Earlier on September 26, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin urged External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to take immediate diplomatic initiatives to ensure consular access and legal assistance to secure an early release of 28 fishermen from the Idinthakarai fishing village of Tirunelveli district apprehended by the Bahrain Coast Guard on September 11.
In his letter, Stalin highlighted that the fishermen, employed in Iran, were apprehended by Bahrain’s Coast Guard on September 11 for allegedly crossing maritime borders. He noted that the boats they were operating belonged to Iranian nationals, and their arrest had severely impacted their families, who rely on their income.
“The families of the fishermen, who are highly dependent on their income, have been severely impacted by the arrest,” he said.
CM Stalin had also requested the EAM Jaishankar to take immediate diplomatic initiatives to ensure consular access and legal assistance to secure the early release of the arrested fishermen. (ANI)

Title: India reveals ambitious space station plans, accelerates private-sector role
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:10:47 +0000
Content: India is accelerating its space ambitions with the announcement of the Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS), a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space station designed to establish a sustained human presence in space. The station aims to support medium- to long-duration human spaceflight missions and enable advanced scientific research and technology development in microgravity.
Union Minister of State for Science and Technology Dr Jitendra Singh revealed on Wednesday that the first module of BAS, known as BAS-01, is scheduled for launch in 2028. The station is expected to become fully operational by 2035. This milestone is part of a broader expansion of the Gaganyaan programme, which now includes precursor missions to BAS, reflecting India’s growing capabilities in human spaceflight.
In addition to the BAS project, the central government has been actively fostering private-sector participation in the space sector to drive innovation and large-scale investment. The Indian government estimates that the nation’s space economy, currently valued at $8.4 billion and representing 2-3% of the global market, has the potential to reach $44 billion by 2033, with private-sector involvement playing a crucial role in achieving this growth.
The liberalised space policy now allows non-governmental entities to undertake comprehensive space activities. To facilitate this, the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) was established to promote, authorise, and oversee private-sector involvement.
The government has implemented a range of initiatives to encourage private-sector growth. These include the Indian Space Policy 2023, which offers regulatory certainty for stakeholders, and a ₹1,000 crore venture capital fund dedicated to supporting space start-ups. IN-SPACe has also introduced various support schemes, including seed funding, mentorship, and skill development programmes, as well as facilitating technology transfers for small satellite launch vehicles and Earth observation systems.
The impact of these efforts is evident in the growth of space start-ups in India, which have increased from just one in 2014 to 266 today. IN-SPACe has signed 71 agreements with private entities, enabling them to contribute to the development of launch vehicles and satellites. 
Additionally, initiatives such as public-private partnerships in Earth observation systems and revised FDI policies are further opening doors for foreign investment in the Indian space sector.
India’s Department of Space has also been advancing ground station capabilities. It has successfully developed a Tri-band Data Reception System that enables cost-effective tracking and data reception from remote sensing satellites. These capabilities have been leveraged to support 17 satellite and launch vehicle missions on a commercial basis.
The Department of Space has made Earth observation data widely accessible. Data with a spatial resolution of five metres is available for free, while higher-resolution data is offered at no cost to government entities and at fair prices to private players.
NSIL, ISRO’s commercial arm, has been providing tracking facilities and satellite data services to domestic and international clients as part of its “Ground Station as a Service” initiative. This reflects the increasing commercialisation of India’s space capabilities.
To streamline processes for private players, IN-SPACe is exploring the creation of a single-window interface for authorisations, approvals, and licences, aimed at reducing administrative hurdles for companies operating in the space sector.

Title: Cricket community lauds Ashwin after he calls time on his international career
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:08:34 +0000
Content: The cricketing fraternity took to social media to praise 38-year-old off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin after he announced his retirement from Test cricket, following the conclusion of the Brisbane Test at the Gabba on Wednesday.
Former India cricketer Dinesh Karthik, who shared the dressing room with Ashwin both internationally and domestically, commended him on his remarkable career. “A GOAT retires. Well done on what’s been an outstanding career. Proud to have played with you and definitely the greatest ever to have played from Tamil Nadu @ashwinravi99. Much love and enjoy some leisurely time with family and friends,” Karthik wrote on X.
West Indies legend Ian Bishop lauded Ashwin’s contributions during his illustrious 14-year international career. “Thank you, Ravi Ashwin. Glad you came, and that you were a part of the international game for so long, with such excellence. You taught, you educated, and you entertained,” Ian Bishop wrote on X.
Former India captain and leg-spinner, Anil Kumble, congratulated Ashwin on his “stellar” career. “@ashwinravi99 your journey has been nothing short of extraordinary! With over 700 international wickets and a keen cricketing mind, you are one of the finest to have graced the field. Congratulations on a stellar career, and here’s to an even brighter future off the field!” Kumble posted on X.
India’s right-handed batter, KL Rahul, praised Ashwin for his skill, determination, and passion for the game. “Congratulations on a legendary career, Ash! Your skill, determination, and passion for the game have inspired us all. It’s been an honour to share the field and the dressing room with you. Wishing you all the best for what lies ahead. @ashwinravi99,” Rahul posted on X.
Veteran batter Cheteshwar Pujara reflected on the moments shared with Ashwin during their time in the national team. “Many congratulations on a career you can be very proud of, Ash! Your dedication and contribution to Indian cricket over a long period will be etched in history as one of the best to have represented the country! Over the years, we have shared countless memories on and off the field, and your decision today suddenly brings a lump in the throat and a flashback of some of the great times we have shared. While this chapter may have ended, I am sure you will continue to contribute to Indian cricket and the game at large. Wishing you and your family all the best for the future. As a teammate and friend, it has truly been an honour and a pleasure to have played with you!” Pujara wrote on X.
Karnataka opener Mayank Agarwal described Ashwin’s retirement as befitting a legend. “He came, he saw, he conquered, and he left like a legend! This is so your style to spin this sudden announcement, Ashley!! One of the best spinners I have had the privilege of sharing the dressing room with. Thank you for the magic, the memories, and the mastery. Continue to spin your all-round magic wherever you go,” Agarwal wrote on X.
Earlier, Ashwin appeared alongside India’s captain, Rohit Sharma, at the post-match press conference to announce his decision. Speculation about his retirement began to build when he became emotional and was hugged by Virat Kohli in the dressing room. 
Ashwin played 106 Tests, taking a staggering 537 wickets, including 37 five-wicket hauls, and scored 3,503 runs. His contributions to Indian cricket extend far beyond these impressive statistics. He is the seventh-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket history and the second-highest for India, behind Anil Kumble (619). He also has the second-most five-wicket hauls in Tests, after Sri Lankan legend Muttiah Muralitharan (67). 
Ashwin was instrumental in India’s dominance in Test cricket, particularly during their rise to the top from 2014 to 2019.
In limited-overs cricket, Ashwin played 181 matches and took 228 wickets. He featured in 116 ODIs, claiming 156 wickets with best figures of 4/25 and scoring 707 runs. In 65 T20Is, he took 72 wickets, with best figures of 4/8, and scored 184 runs. With 765 international wickets across formats, Ashwin is India’s second-highest wicket-taker, behind Kumble (953). 
Ashwin was also part of India’s 2011 World Cup-winning squad and the 2013 Champions Trophy team.

Title: Tom Cruise honored with US Navy’s highest civilian award
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:05:41 +0000
Content: Hollywood star Tom Cruise has received the US Navy’s highest civilian honor for his “outstanding contributions” to the military through his work on screen.
It was with the 1986 blockbuster Top Gun that Cruise shot to fame, with the film’s record-breaking success boosting military enlistment.
The Distinguished Public Service Award was presented to Cruise on Tuesday at the Longcross Film Studios in Chertsey, Surrey, reports BBC.com.
The 61-year-old star expressed his gratitude for the “extraordinary acknowledgment.” “I admire all of the servicemen and women,” Cruise said, standing beside US Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro, who handed him the certificate and medal.
Cruise emphasized his belief that “to lead is to serve,” adding, “I know this to my core, and I see that in the servicemen and women.”
The Navy credited Cruise with increasing public awareness and appreciation for the sacrifices made by its highly trained personnel. His role as pilot Maverick in Top Gun, a movie about Cold War flying aces, was so influential that the Navy even set up recruitment tables in theaters to capitalize on its popularity.
Cruise reprised his role as Lieutenant Pete Mitchell in the 2022 sequel Top Gun: Maverick, which the Navy said “reinvigorated” interest in the military among younger audiences.
On Tuesday, Del Toro added, “Tom Cruise has spent nearly four decades as an unwavering supporter of the men, women, and families of the Navy and Marine Corps.”
Cruise was also celebrated for his roles in other iconic films, including Born on the Fourth of July, A Few Good Men, and the Mission: Impossible series. He is currently in Chertsey, Surrey, working on his next film, Mission: Impossible: The Final Reckoning, set for release in May 2025.
The prestigious civilian honor has previously been awarded to luminaries such as Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks for their work on the World War II epic Saving Private Ryan.

Title: Russian foreign ministry says Ukraine repeatedly dropped white phosphorus from drones
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:01:04 +0000
Content: Russia said on Wednesday that Ukraine had repeatedly dropped white phosphorus munitions from drones in September, but Kyiv denied it had used such weapons and said it was Moscow which had used prohibited chemical substances on the battlefield.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said law enforcement agencies had evidence of the use of such munitions by Ukraine, but she did not provide details.
“The law enforcement agencies of our country, together with the Russian Defence Ministry, have received irrefutable evidence of the repeated use of white phosphorus ammunition dropped from drones by the armed forces of Ukraine in September,” Zakharova said.
Ukraine, which has accused Russia of using phosphorus in the war, said Zakharova’s statement was false and accused Russia of using prohibited chemical substances on the battlefield.
“The Russian accusations are false and nonsensical,” foreign ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi told Reuters in a written statement.
“Ukraine has always been and continues to be a reliable participant in multilateral regimes for the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and it faithfully complies with the international obligations stemming from their provisions.”

Title: Sensex, Nifty end lower ahead of US Fed rate decision
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 11:55:23 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices declined on Wednesday as cautious investor sentiment prevailed ahead of the US Federal Reserve’s policy decision later in the day.
The Sensex dropped 502.25 points, or 0.62 percent, to close at 80,182.20, while the Nifty fell 137.15 points, or 0.56 percent, to settle at 24,198.85.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), 1,447 shares ended in the green, while 2,558 declined, and 94 remained unchanged.
In the Sensex pack, the top gainers included TCS, Sun Pharma, Tech Mahindra, HCL Tech, M&M, ITC, and Infosys, while Tata Motors, Power Grid, NTPC, JSW Steel, ICICI Bank, L&T, Bajaj Finance, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, and SBI were among the major laggards.
Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, said that market sentiment remained subdued ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, with investors wary of potential shifts in policy and tariffs under the incoming US administration. The US Federal Reserve, which had been maintaining steady interest rates, implemented a total of 75 basis points in rate cuts during its September and November reviews.
Nair pointed out that concerns over India’s high market valuation have contributed to investor caution. The valuation is seen as exceeding current earnings growth, which has decelerated over the past two quarters.
Additionally, India’s trade deficit for November, which reached a record USD 37.84 billion due to increased imports, further weighed on market sentiment.

Title: Leader of former Syrian opposition says transitional government should not exclude any party
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 11:51:48 +0000
Content: Hadi al-Bahra, head of the Syrian National Coalition that grouped opponents of Bashar al-Assad during the civil war, said on Wednesday Syria’s transitional government should be credible and not exclude any Syrian party or be based on sectarianism.
In a seismic moment for the Middle East, Syrian rebels seized control of Damascus on Dec. 8, forcing Assad to flee after more than 13 years of civil war, ending his family’s decades-long rule.
The lightning offensive raised questions over whether the rebels will be able to ensure an orderly transition.
Representatives of the Syrian National Coalition had not met Syrian rebel leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, but had communications with the caretaker government and parties close to him, al-Bahra said during a press conference in Istanbul.
Forces under the command of al-Sharaa – better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani – replaced the Assad family rule with a three-month transitional government that had been ruling a rebel enclave in Syria’s northwestern province of Idlib.
Al-Sharaa is the leader of the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which is designated a terrorist group by Western and regional powers.
Newly appointed Prime Minister Mohammed al-Bashir formerly led an HTS-affiliated government in Idlib.
The Syrian National Coalition would return to Syria and set up headquarters there, former Syrian opposition leader al-Bahra said, adding that he intended to return as well.
“Logistics should be worked out and freedom of speech should be guaranteed,” he added.

Content: The total number of mobile subscriptions in the country now stands at 115.12 crore (as on October 31), the Parliament was informed on Wednesday.
Out of 6,44,131 villages in the country, around 6,23,622 villages now have mobile coverage, Minister of State for Communications and Rural Development, Dr Chandra Sekhar Pemmasani, told the Lok Sabha in a written reply to a question.
Mobile coverage for inhabited uncovered villages is provided by the government and the telecom service providers (TSPs) in a phased manner, he added.
Further, the government is implementing various schemes and projects under Digital Bharat Nidhi (DBN) for the expansion of telecom connectivity through the installation of mobile towers in rural, remote, and hilly areas of the country, said the minister.
In addition, the BharatNet project (earlier known as National Optical Fiber Network) being funded by Digital Bharat Nidhi is being implemented in a phased manner to provide broadband connectivity to all Gram Panchayats (GPs) in the country.
The amended BharatNet Programme was approved by Cabinet for the up-gradation of the existing network of BharatNet Phase-I and Phase-II, creation of a network in the remaining nearly 42,000 gram panchayats, operation and maintenance for 10 years and utilisation at the total cost of Rs 1,39,579 crore, said Dr Pemmasani.
Last week, the government informed that mobile network coverage in rural India has reached nearly 97 per cent and at least 6,14,564 villages are covered with 4G mobile connectivity.
In a reply to a question in Rajya Sabha, Dr Pemmasani said that under the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN) of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, 4,543 particularly vulnerable tribal group (PVTG) habitations were identified as mobile uncovered and out of these, 1,136 PVTG habitations have been covered with mobile connectivity.
In the meantime, 5G services are now available in 779 districts out of 783 districts in the country (as of October 31). Further, more than 4.6 lakh 5G Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) have been installed in the country, informed the minister.

Title: Many factors distort blood pressure readings: report
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 11:24:28 +0000
Content: Blood pressure readings are often distorted due to skipped steps in measurement, such as sitting posture, arm positioning, recent caffeine intake, or talking during the process. These factors can produce readings higher or lower than normal, highlighting the need for precise procedures to assess cardiovascular health accurately.
“To make meaningful improvements in cardiovascular health, we need to screen and treat hypertension correctly,” said Tammy Brady, a pediatric nephrologist at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.
Accurate blood pressure readings are critical for preventing heart attacks, strokes, and other life-threatening conditions. Guidelines from the American Heart Association recommend that patients sit with both feet on the ground, legs uncrossed, back straight, and arms supported on a surface. The cuff should be positioned over a bare arm at heart level, and distractions like talking or using a phone should be avoided.
The World Health Organisation reports that 1.28 billion adults worldwide have hypertension, with 46% unaware of their condition.
Last month, an international study led by the University of Sydney and University College London suggested that even five minutes of daily physical activity, such as walking uphill or stair climbing, could significantly reduce blood pressure. Researchers estimate that replacing 20-27 minutes of sedentary behavior with exercise can lead to clinically meaningful reductions in blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular disease incidence by 28%.

Title: France’s highest court upholds Sarkozy’s corruption conviction
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 14:11:12 +0000
Content: The Cour de Cassation, France’s highest court, upheld on Wednesday former President Nicolas Sarkozy’s conviction for corruption and influence peddling.
Sarkozy had appealed against the 2021 conviction for corruption and influence peddling, in which he had been handed a three-year prison sentence. Two of the years were suspended and Sarkozy would wear an electronic monitoring bracelet instead of going to prison for the last year.
Patrice Spinosi, lawyer for Sarkozy, said Sarkozy would appeal to the European Court for Human Rights to challenge the ruling.
Spinosi added Sarkozy would comply with the ruling which forces him to wear an electronic bracelet but would continue to use all legal means available to him to prove his innocence.
Sarkozy, a conservative who remains an important figure in French politics even after leaving office in 2012, had been found guilty by a lower court of trying to bribe a judge and of peddling influence in exchange for confidential information about a probe into his 2007 campaign finances.
The court found that Sarkozy conspired to secure a job in Monaco for a judge in exchange for inside information about an investigation into allegations that Sarkozy had accepted illegal payments from L’Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt.
The judge, Gilbert Azibert, was also convicted for corruption and influence peddling.
Sarkozy is expected to stand trial next year on corruption and illegal financing charges related to alleged Libyan funding of his successful 2007 presidential bid. Sarkozy denies all wrongdoing.
If convicted in the Libya case, Sarkozy could face up to 10 years in prison.
Sarkozy’s predecessor, Jacques Chirac, a fellow conservative, is the only other president in modern French history to be convicted by a court. Chirac was found guilty of corruption in 2011, four years after he left office.

The embassy, in a post on X, shared the update, saying, “India in Bahrain is pleased to announce repatriation of 28 Indian fishermen who were recently freed after reduction in sentence from 6 to 3 months. The embassy facilitated legal assistance and travel under GoI’s Indian Community Welfare Fund. Well-being of Indian nationals is our priority.”
The Indian Embassy also thanked the Bahraini authorities for “cooperation.” In another post on X, it wrote, “We thank the Bahraini authorities for cooperation & swift response including for providing consular access. Wishing them a safe return to their families in India.”
Earlier on September 26, Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin urged External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to take immediate diplomatic initiatives to ensure consular access and legal assistance to secure an early release of 28 fishermen from the Idinthakarai fishing village of Tirunelveli district apprehended by the Bahrain Coast Guard on September 11.
In his letter, Stalin highlighted that the fishermen, employed in Iran, were apprehended by Bahrain’s Coast Guard on September 11 for allegedly crossing maritime borders. He noted that the boats they were operating belonged to Iranian nationals, and their arrest had severely impacted their families, who rely on their income.
“The families of the fishermen, who are highly dependent on their income, have been severely impacted by the arrest,” he said.
CM Stalin had also requested the EAM Jaishankar to take immediate diplomatic initiatives to ensure consular access and legal assistance to secure the early release of the arrested fishermen. (ANI)

Title: India reveals ambitious space station plans, accelerates private-sector role
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:10:47 +0000
Content: India is accelerating its space ambitions with the announcement of the Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS), a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) space station designed to establish a sustained human presence in space. The station aims to support medium- to long-duration human spaceflight missions and enable advanced scientific research and technology development in microgravity.
Union Minister of State for Science and Technology Dr Jitendra Singh revealed on Wednesday that the first module of BAS, known as BAS-01, is scheduled for launch in 2028. The station is expected to become fully operational by 2035. This milestone is part of a broader expansion of the Gaganyaan programme, which now includes precursor missions to BAS, reflecting India’s growing capabilities in human spaceflight.
In addition to the BAS project, the central government has been actively fostering private-sector participation in the space sector to drive innovation and large-scale investment. The Indian government estimates that the nation’s space economy, currently valued at $8.4 billion and representing 2-3% of the global market, has the potential to reach $44 billion by 2033, with private-sector involvement playing a crucial role in achieving this growth.
The liberalised space policy now allows non-governmental entities to undertake comprehensive space activities. To facilitate this, the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) was established to promote, authorise, and oversee private-sector involvement.
The government has implemented a range of initiatives to encourage private-sector growth. These include the Indian Space Policy 2023, which offers regulatory certainty for stakeholders, and a ₹1,000 crore venture capital fund dedicated to supporting space start-ups. IN-SPACe has also introduced various support schemes, including seed funding, mentorship, and skill development programmes, as well as facilitating technology transfers for small satellite launch vehicles and Earth observation systems.
The impact of these efforts is evident in the growth of space start-ups in India, which have increased from just one in 2014 to 266 today. IN-SPACe has signed 71 agreements with private entities, enabling them to contribute to the development of launch vehicles and satellites. 
Additionally, initiatives such as public-private partnerships in Earth observation systems and revised FDI policies are further opening doors for foreign investment in the Indian space sector.
India’s Department of Space has also been advancing ground station capabilities. It has successfully developed a Tri-band Data Reception System that enables cost-effective tracking and data reception from remote sensing satellites. These capabilities have been leveraged to support 17 satellite and launch vehicle missions on a commercial basis.
The Department of Space has made Earth observation data widely accessible. Data with a spatial resolution of five metres is available for free, while higher-resolution data is offered at no cost to government entities and at fair prices to private players.
NSIL, ISRO’s commercial arm, has been providing tracking facilities and satellite data services to domestic and international clients as part of its “Ground Station as a Service” initiative. This reflects the increasing commercialisation of India’s space capabilities.
To streamline processes for private players, IN-SPACe is exploring the creation of a single-window interface for authorisations, approvals, and licences, aimed at reducing administrative hurdles for companies operating in the space sector.

Title: Cricket community lauds Ashwin after he calls time on his international career
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:08:34 +0000
Content: The cricketing fraternity took to social media to praise 38-year-old off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin after he announced his retirement from Test cricket, following the conclusion of the Brisbane Test at the Gabba on Wednesday.
Former India cricketer Dinesh Karthik, who shared the dressing room with Ashwin both internationally and domestically, commended him on his remarkable career. “A GOAT retires. Well done on what’s been an outstanding career. Proud to have played with you and definitely the greatest ever to have played from Tamil Nadu @ashwinravi99. Much love and enjoy some leisurely time with family and friends,” Karthik wrote on X.
West Indies legend Ian Bishop lauded Ashwin’s contributions during his illustrious 14-year international career. “Thank you, Ravi Ashwin. Glad you came, and that you were a part of the international game for so long, with such excellence. You taught, you educated, and you entertained,” Ian Bishop wrote on X.
Former India captain and leg-spinner, Anil Kumble, congratulated Ashwin on his “stellar” career. “@ashwinravi99 your journey has been nothing short of extraordinary! With over 700 international wickets and a keen cricketing mind, you are one of the finest to have graced the field. Congratulations on a stellar career, and here’s to an even brighter future off the field!” Kumble posted on X.
India’s right-handed batter, KL Rahul, praised Ashwin for his skill, determination, and passion for the game. “Congratulations on a legendary career, Ash! Your skill, determination, and passion for the game have inspired us all. It’s been an honour to share the field and the dressing room with you. Wishing you all the best for what lies ahead. @ashwinravi99,” Rahul posted on X.
Veteran batter Cheteshwar Pujara reflected on the moments shared with Ashwin during their time in the national team. “Many congratulations on a career you can be very proud of, Ash! Your dedication and contribution to Indian cricket over a long period will be etched in history as one of the best to have represented the country! Over the years, we have shared countless memories on and off the field, and your decision today suddenly brings a lump in the throat and a flashback of some of the great times we have shared. While this chapter may have ended, I am sure you will continue to contribute to Indian cricket and the game at large. Wishing you and your family all the best for the future. As a teammate and friend, it has truly been an honour and a pleasure to have played with you!” Pujara wrote on X.
Karnataka opener Mayank Agarwal described Ashwin’s retirement as befitting a legend. “He came, he saw, he conquered, and he left like a legend! This is so your style to spin this sudden announcement, Ashley!! One of the best spinners I have had the privilege of sharing the dressing room with. Thank you for the magic, the memories, and the mastery. Continue to spin your all-round magic wherever you go,” Agarwal wrote on X.
Earlier, Ashwin appeared alongside India’s captain, Rohit Sharma, at the post-match press conference to announce his decision. Speculation about his retirement began to build when he became emotional and was hugged by Virat Kohli in the dressing room. 
Ashwin played 106 Tests, taking a staggering 537 wickets, including 37 five-wicket hauls, and scored 3,503 runs. His contributions to Indian cricket extend far beyond these impressive statistics. He is the seventh-highest wicket-taker in Test cricket history and the second-highest for India, behind Anil Kumble (619). He also has the second-most five-wicket hauls in Tests, after Sri Lankan legend Muttiah Muralitharan (67). 
Ashwin was instrumental in India’s dominance in Test cricket, particularly during their rise to the top from 2014 to 2019.
In limited-overs cricket, Ashwin played 181 matches and took 228 wickets. He featured in 116 ODIs, claiming 156 wickets with best figures of 4/25 and scoring 707 runs. In 65 T20Is, he took 72 wickets, with best figures of 4/8, and scored 184 runs. With 765 international wickets across formats, Ashwin is India’s second-highest wicket-taker, behind Kumble (953). 
Ashwin was also part of India’s 2011 World Cup-winning squad and the 2013 Champions Trophy team.

Title: Tom Cruise honored with US Navy’s highest civilian award
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:05:41 +0000
Content: Hollywood star Tom Cruise has received the US Navy’s highest civilian honor for his “outstanding contributions” to the military through his work on screen.
It was with the 1986 blockbuster Top Gun that Cruise shot to fame, with the film’s record-breaking success boosting military enlistment.
The Distinguished Public Service Award was presented to Cruise on Tuesday at the Longcross Film Studios in Chertsey, Surrey, reports BBC.com.
The 61-year-old star expressed his gratitude for the “extraordinary acknowledgment.” “I admire all of the servicemen and women,” Cruise said, standing beside US Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro, who handed him the certificate and medal.
Cruise emphasized his belief that “to lead is to serve,” adding, “I know this to my core, and I see that in the servicemen and women.”
The Navy credited Cruise with increasing public awareness and appreciation for the sacrifices made by its highly trained personnel. His role as pilot Maverick in Top Gun, a movie about Cold War flying aces, was so influential that the Navy even set up recruitment tables in theaters to capitalize on its popularity.
Cruise reprised his role as Lieutenant Pete Mitchell in the 2022 sequel Top Gun: Maverick, which the Navy said “reinvigorated” interest in the military among younger audiences.
On Tuesday, Del Toro added, “Tom Cruise has spent nearly four decades as an unwavering supporter of the men, women, and families of the Navy and Marine Corps.”
Cruise was also celebrated for his roles in other iconic films, including Born on the Fourth of July, A Few Good Men, and the Mission: Impossible series. He is currently in Chertsey, Surrey, working on his next film, Mission: Impossible: The Final Reckoning, set for release in May 2025.
The prestigious civilian honor has previously been awarded to luminaries such as Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks for their work on the World War II epic Saving Private Ryan.

Title: Russian foreign ministry says Ukraine repeatedly dropped white phosphorus from drones
Publication Date: Wed, 18 Dec 2024 12:01:04 +0000
Content: Russia said on Wednesday that Ukraine had repeatedly dropped white phosphorus munitions from drones in September, but Kyiv denied it had used such weapons and said it was Moscow which had used prohibited chemical substances on the battlefield.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said law enforcement agencies had evidence of the use of such munitions by Ukraine, but she did not provide details.
“The law enforcement agencies of our country, together with the Russian Defence Ministry, have received irrefutable evidence of the repeated use of white phosphorus ammunition dropped from drones by the armed forces of Ukraine in September,” Zakharova said.
Ukraine, which has accused Russia of using phosphorus in the war, said Zakharova’s statement was false and accused Russia of using prohibited chemical substances on the battlefield.
“The Russian accusations are false and nonsensical,” foreign ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi told Reuters in a written statement.
“Ukraine has always been and continues to be a reliable participant in multilateral regimes for the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and it faithfully complies with the international obligations stemming from their provisions.”

Title: Fed lowers rates but sees fewer cuts next year due to stubbornly high inflation
Publication Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 06:16:02 +0000
Content: The U.S. central bank cut interest rates on Wednesday, as expected, but Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said more reductions in borrowing costs now hinge on further progress in lowering stubbornly high inflation, remarks that showed policymakers are starting to reckon with the prospects for sweeping economic changes under a Trump administration.
Powell’s explicit – and repeated – references to the need for caution from here on jolted Wall Street, sending stocks sharply lower, bond yields higher and leading investors to dial back estimates of how far borrowing costs are likely to fall over the coming year.
“I think we’re in a good place, but I think from here it’s a new phase and we’re going to be cautious about further cuts,” Powell said at a press conference after the central bank’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point at the end of a two-day meeting.
Powell described at length the ways in which inflation has improved since peaking in 2022, as well as the ways it has disappointed by moving “sideways” in recent months, with shelter costs in particular improving more slowly than the Fed expected.
While he said the Fed remained confident price pressures would continue to ease, he also acknowledged central bank staff and policymakers were beginning to at least preliminarily think through how President-elect Donald Trump’s promises of higher tariffs, tax cuts and tougher immigration policy will change the outlook.
In developing new projections, “some people did take a very preliminary step and start to incorporate highly conditional estimates of economic effects of policies into their forecasts at this meeting,” Powell said of an outlook in which U.S. central bankers anticipated a higher inflation outlook and fewer rate cuts next year.
An index of policymakers’ sense of risk around their projections also shifted sharply higher for inflation, with a separate measure of uncertainty increasing as well in an abrupt change from the outlook issued in September, before the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election.
Powell said those changes were largely driven by data, but analysts saw the beginnings of a reckoning with Trump policies that many expect will add to inflation pressures.
The new projections show officials expect the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy costs, or core PCE, to be stuck at 2.5% through 2025, an improvement over this year’s 2.8% but significantly higher than the Fed’s 2% target.
“Uncertainty and upside risks to core PCE inflation both up sharply since September. This seems to largely reflect new government policies’ potential impact,” said Karim Basta, chief economist with III Capital Management.
ONE DISSENT
The Fed, which hiked rates aggressively in 2022 and 2023 to combat a surge in inflation, began its easing cycle in September with a half-percentage-point cut in borrowing costs, and followed up with a quarter-percentage-point cut last month.
Going into this week’s meeting the central bank had been widely expected to deliver a “hawkish” rate cut by estimating roughly half the policy easing in 2025 than the 100 basis points policymakers had projected three months ago. But by the time Powell had finished speaking, only one 25-basis-point cut for next year was reflected in market pricing.
The changed outlook highlights some of the challenges Trump may face delivering on key campaign promises, with tighter Fed policy likely keeping important consumer interest rates like those on home mortgages elevated, and less improvement on inflation undermining his pledge to lower prices.
Powell even said the decision to lower the policy rate to the 4.25%-4.50% range this time was a “closer call” than implied by financial markets that considered the cut a near certainty ahead of the meeting.
The decision drew a dissent from Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack, who joined the central bank earlier this year and indicated she would have preferred to leave rates unchanged at this week’s meeting.
But Powell was also clear that the baseline outlook was for the economy to continue to perform well with ongoing growth, low unemployment and inflation that officials expect to drift slowly lower.
Rates will fall again once inflation shows it is making more progress, “with the extent and timing of additional adjustments to the target range” depending on “incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks,” the Fed said in new language that sets up a likely pause to the rate cuts beginning at the Jan. 28-29 meeting.
U.S. central bankers now project they will make just two quarter-percentage-point rate reductions by the end of 2025.
That is half a percentage point less in policy easing next year than officials anticipated as of September, with Fed projections of inflation for the first year of the new Trump administration jumping from 2.1% in their prior projections to 2.5% in the current ones.
Slower progress on inflation, which is not seen returning to the 2% target until 2027, translates into a slower pace of rate cuts and a slightly higher ending point for rates at 3.1%, also to be hit in 2027, versus the prior “terminal” rate of 2.9% seen as of September.
TRUMP UNCERTAINTY
The new policy rate is now a percentage point lower than the peak reached in September when officials concluded inflation was likely on the way back to the 2% target and that there were risks to the job market of keeping monetary policy too tight for too long.
Key measures of inflation have changed little since then, while continued low unemployment and stronger-than-expected economic growth have sparked debate among policymakers about whether monetary policy is as tight as thought.
Though Trump doesn’t take office until Jan. 20, Powell said that Fed staff have been gaming out different scenarios for what could be an unpredictable year.
“It’s very premature to try to make any kind of conclusion. We don’t know what will be tariffed, from what countries, for how long and what size. We don’t know whether there will be retaliatory tariffs,” Powell said. “What the Committee is doing now is discussing pathways and understanding the ways in which tariffs can affect inflation.”

Title: Amazon workers to strike at multiple US warehouses during busy holiday season
Publication Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 05:59:37 +0000
Content: Thousands of Amazon.com workers will walk off the job on Thursday morning, in the crucial final days of the holiday season, after union officials said the retailer failed to come to the bargaining table to negotiate contracts.
The strike is a challenge to Amazon’s operations as it races to fulfill orders during its busiest season of the year, although union-represented facilities represent only about 1% of Amazon’s hourly workforce. In the New York City area, for example, the company has multiple warehouses and smaller delivery depots.
The International Brotherhood of Teamsters said unionized workers at facilities in New York City; Skokie, Illinois; Atlanta, San Francisco and southern California will join the picket line to seek contracts guaranteeing better wages and work conditions.
The Teamsters union has said it represents about 10,000 workers at 10 of the company’s U.S. facilities. Workers at seven of those facilities will walk out on Thursday, the Teamsters said.
An Amazon spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.
The union had given Amazon a deadline of Sunday to begin negotiations, and workers at facilities voted recently to authorize a strike.
Teamsters local unions are also putting up picket lines at hundreds of Amazon Fulfillment Centers nationwide, the union said in a statement on Wednesday.
Observers said Amazon is unlikely to come to the table to bargain, calculating it could open the door to additional union actions.
“Amazon clearly has developed a strategy of ignoring their workers’ rights to collectively organize and negotiate,” said Benjamin Sachs, a Harvard Law School professor of labor and industry.
He noted that more than two years after workers at a Staten Island warehouse became the first in the United States to vote to unionize, Amazon still has not recognized the group.
RIGHT TO ORGANIZE
Amazon, which has said it prefers direct relationships with workers, has challenged union drives while saying workers have the right to organize.
The company has filed objections with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) over the 2022 Staten Island election, alleging bias among agency officials, among other issues. Further, Amazon challenged the constitutionality of the NLRB itself in a September federal lawsuit.
The Seattle-based company has also said the Teamsters “attempted to coerce” workers illegally to join the union.
The Teamsters said the Staten Island warehouse could join the strike at any time, as well as another southern California facility that had earlier voted to join the walkout.
Amazon is unlikely, at least initially, to come to the table with the Teamsters because there is little legal pressure to do so, said Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor at Washington University in St. Louis who has studied unions. He noted that there has been no apparent penalty to Amazon for ignoring the Staten Island workers’ demands.
“It’s been a very successful strategy, the work continues there and there is still no contract,” said Rosenfeld.
In recent years, Amazon.com has faced worker walkouts in Spain and Germany, among other regions, over pay and working conditions.
As the world’s second-largest private employer after Walmart WMT.O, Amazon has long been a target for unions. Some workers have said Amazon’s emphasis on greater speed and efficiency can lead to injuries, while Amazon has said it pays industry-leading wages and regularly introduces automation designed to reduce repetitive stress.
The company will face other union actions in the months ahead. Workers at a Philadelphia Whole Foods in November filed to hold a union election, the first since Amazon acquired the grocery chain in 2017.
Last month, an administrative judge ordered a third union election at an Alabama warehouse after ruling Amazon had acted unlawfully to thwart unionization there.
Earlier this year, Amazon announced a $2.1 billion investment to raise pay for fulfillment and transportation employees in the U.S., increasing base wages for employees by at least $1.50 to around $22 per hour, a roughly 7% increase.

Content: Indian Ambassador to the U.S. Vinay Mohan Kwatra, along with U.S. Deputy Secretary Kurt Campbell and Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer, visited NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston on Wednesday and met with representatives from NASA and ISRO, including two Indian astronauts undergoing training at the facility.
These astronauts are preparing for a proposed mission to the International Space Station (ISS) scheduled for 2025, which will mark a significant milestone in India-U.S. collaboration on human spaceflight.
A press statement from the US Department of State highlighted the importance of this collaboration. The discussions included plans to launch the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) satellite in 2025, a joint Earth science mission aimed at providing critical environmental data.
In a post on X, Ambassador Kwatra said, “Wonderful to visit the Johnson Space Center of @NASA with @DeputySecState Kurt Campbell and Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer. Had the opportunity to discuss India and US space cooperation including in human space flight program and enhancing partnership between the two private sectors in the fields of innovation and technology. Was also glad to meet the Indian astronauts training at Houston.”
The visit aligns with the broader vision outlined by President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi during their June 2023 meeting to work together to “reach new frontiers across all sectors of space cooperation” and India’s signing of the Artemis Accords, our two nations reached an inflection point on collaboration across civil, security, and commercial space sectors,” the White House said in a press briefing.
Reflecting on recent achievements, officials emphasized the successful selection of Indian astronauts for training at NASA, the progress on the Axiom-4 mission, and the completion of a Strategic Framework for Human Spaceflight Cooperation. These milestones are seen as key steps in enhancing interoperability between the two nations in space exploration.
In addition to civil space collaboration, the discussions touched on defence-related space initiatives. These include India’s participation in the US Space Command’s Global Sentinel exercise, the launch of a joint space situational awareness challenge under the India-US Defense Acceleration Ecosystem (INDUS-X), and advancing reviews on missile technology exports.
The visit also provided an opportunity to engage with private sector representatives from both countries’ space industries. Discussions focused on innovative ways to strengthen commercial space partnerships, further bridging technological and industrial collaboration between the two nations.

Title: Sensex, Nifty plunge after US Fed signals fewer rate cuts for 2025
Publication Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 04:50:48 +0000
Content: India’s benchmark indices opened sharply lower on Thursday, mirroring a global sell-off after the US Federal Reserve signaled fewer rate cuts for 2025.
The Nifty 50 index plunged 1.33%, shedding 321 points to open at 23,877.15, while the BSE Sensex dropped 1.44%, falling 1,153.17 points to open at 79,029.03.
The downturn comes as investors reacted to the Fed’s reduced rate cut expectations, which dashed hopes of robust economic stimulus and easing inflation. The ripple effect triggered sharp declines across global markets.
Ajay Bagga, a banking and market expert, said, “Risk-off sentiment is hitting all markets today. The Fed’s revised projections for 2025 have led to a steep sell-off in US equities, precious metals like gold and silver, emerging market currencies against the US dollar, and rising bond yields. Asian markets, including India, are facing similar sell-offs, leading to a gap-down opening on weak global cues.”
Sectoral indices on the NSE faced broad declines, with Nifty IT, Nifty Metal, and Nifty PSU Bank suffering the steepest losses.
Akshay Chinchalkar, Head of Research at Axis Securities, said, “The Nifty is opening weak, with critical support at 24,000. A breach below the November 28 trough of 23,873 would invalidate the bullish head-and-shoulders pattern targeting 25,500. If that happens, the next vulnerable level will be 23,300. Immediate resistance is at 24,500.”
In the Nifty 50, only three stocks—Dr. Reddy’s, Hindustan Unilever, and ITC—managed gains, while 47 stocks declined at the time of reporting.
The sell-off extended to other Asian markets, with Japan’s Nikkei 225 down 0.96%, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index losing 1.06%, South Korea’s Kospi declining 1.58%, and Taiwan’s Weighted Index falling 1.35%.
US markets also faced a sharp downturn after the Fed announcement. The S&P 500 fell 2.95%, losing 178 points to close at 5,872. The tech-heavy Nasdaq dropped 3.28%, shedding 658 points to settle at 19,450.

Title: Bangladesh: Lutfozzaman Babar, five others acquitted in ten-truck arms haul case
Publication Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 03:49:26 +0000
Content: In Bangladesh, the High Court has acquitted former state minister for home affairs Lutfozzaman Babar and five others, who were sentenced to death, in the 10-truck arms haul case in Chattogram.
The court also commuted the death sentence of six convicts to 10 years’ imprisonment in the case. Indian separatist outfit United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) chief Paresh Barua, another death-row convict, had his sentence reduced to life imprisonment, reports United News of Bangladesh (UNB).
The 10-truck arms haul case is believed to be the largest arms smuggling incident in the history of Bangladesh. Investigators believed that delivery was intended for the ULFA.
The case dates back to April 1, 2004, when 10 truckloads of arms were seized at the Chittagong Urea Fertilizer Limited (CUFL) jetty. Two cases – one under the Arms Act and another under the Special Powers Act – were filed with Karnaphuli Police Station the following day, naming 50 people as accused in the arms case and 52 in the other.
On January 30, 2014, Chattogram Metropolitan Sessions Judge SM Mujibur Rahman sentenced 14 people to death under the Special Powers Act. They were also handed life imprisonment and seven years’ imprisonment each under two sections of the arms case, reports UNB.
The 14 sentenced to death included former Jamaat-e-Islami chief Motiur Rahman Nizami, former state minister for home Lutfozzaman Babar, ULFA chief Paresh Barua, former DGFI director Maj Gen (retd) Rezzakul Haider Chowdhury, and former NSI director general Abdur Rahim. The charges were related to smuggling under the Special Powers Act.
Of these convicts, Motiur Rahman Nizami was executed in 2016 for crimes against humanity.

Title: Putin says Russia is ready to compromise with Trump on Ukraine war
Publication Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 12:02:47 +0000
Content: President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that he was ready to compromise over Ukraine in possible talks with Donald Trump on ending the war and that Russian forces were moving towards achieving their primary goals on the battlefield.
Trump, a self-styled master of brokering agreements and author of the 1987 book “Trump: the Art of the Deal”, has vowed to swiftly end the conflict, but has not yet given any details on how he might achieve that.
Putin, fielding questions on state TV during his annual question and answer session with Russians, told a reporter for a U.S. news channel that he was ready to meet Trump, whom he said he had not spoken to for years.
Asked what he might be able to offer Trump, Putin dismissed an assertion that Russia was in a weak position, saying that Russia had got much stronger since he ordered troops into Ukraine in 2022.
“We have always said that we are ready for negotiations and compromises,” Putin said after saying that Russian forces, advancing across the entire front, were moving towards achieving their primary goals in Ukraine.
“Soon, those Ukrainians who want to fight will run out, in my opinion, soon there will be no one left who wants to fight. We are ready, but the other side needs to be ready for both negotiations and compromises.”
Reuters reported last month that Putin was open to discussing a Ukraine ceasefire deal with Trump, but ruled out making any major territorial concessions and insisted Kyiv abandon its ambitions to join NATO.
Russia, he said, had made proposals to Syria’s new rulers about Russia’s military bases there and most people that Moscow had spoken to on the issue favoured them staying.
He said Russia would need to think about whether the bases should remain or not, but that rumours about the death of Russian influence in the Middle East were exaggerated.
Asked about the fate of missing U.S. reporter Austin Tice, who was kidnapped in Syria in 2012, Putin said he planned to speak to former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and the new leaders of Syria about the issue. Tice’s family wrote to Putin asking for his help in finding Tice.
War
Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has left tens of thousands of dead, displaced millions and triggered the biggest crisis in relations between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.
Russia, which controls around a fifth of Ukraine, has taken several thousand square kilometres of territory in Ukraine this year, taking village after village and threatening strategically important cities such as Pokrovsk, a major road and rail hub.
Putin said the fighting was complex, so it was “difficult and pointless to guess what lies ahead… (but) we are moving, as you said, towards solving our primary tasks, which we outlined at the beginning of the special military operation.”
On the economy, Putin said it was showing signs of overheating which was stoking worryingly high inflation.
Discussing the continued presence of Ukrainian forces in Russia’s Kursk region, Putin said Kyiv’s troops would definitely be forced out, but declined to say exactly when that would happen.
Putin also touted what he said was the invincibility of the “Oreshnik” hypersonic missile which Russia has already test-fired at a Ukrainian military factory, saying he was ready to organise another launch at Ukraine and see if Western air defence systems could shoot it down.
“Let them determine some target for destruction, say in Kyiv, concentrate all their air defence and missile defence forces there, and we will strike there with Oreshnik and see what happens. We are ready for such an experiment, but is the other side ready?” he said.

Title: First malaria vaccine shows promise amid rising cases: report
Publication Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:39:58 +0000
Content: The first blood-stage malaria vaccine, RH5.1/Matrix-M, has shown promise as a potential component in an evolving malaria vaccine strategy, according to a report released on Thursday.
The report by GlobalData, a data and analytics company, revealed that 11 other malaria vaccines are currently in Phase II development.
A recent study conducted by researchers in Burkina Faso and the UK found that RH5.1/Matrix-M is safe, effective, and highly immunogenic.
The double-blind, randomized, controlled Phase 2b trial involved 361 children aged 5 to 17 months. The findings demonstrated that RH5.1/Matrix-M is 55% effective against clinical malaria when administered in a delayed third-dose regimen at 0, 1, and 5 months.
Moreover, the vaccine exhibited over 80% efficacy against high levels of malaria parasites, suggesting its potential to prevent severe disease. The trial, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, also confirmed that RH5.1/Matrix-M was generally safe and well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported.
“RH5.1/Matrix-M has the potential to be the first blood-stage malaria vaccine brought to market. This could serve as a vital addition to existing malaria vaccines and offer an important second line of defense for those most at risk,” said Stephanie Kurdach, Infectious Disease Analyst at GlobalData.
Malaria, a mosquito-borne disease caused by Plasmodium protozoans, is primarily transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Symptoms can range from fever, chills, and headaches to severe manifestations such as confusion, seizures, and difficulty breathing.
Despite progress, including some nations being certified as malaria-free, the disease remains a significant burden, particularly in the World Health Organization’s (WHO) African Region, Kurdach noted.
Currently, only two malaria vaccines are WHO-prequalified and recommended for use in children: GSK’s Mosquirix and Serum Institute of India’s R21/Matrix-M. These vaccines target the early sporozoite stage of the parasite to intercept infection. However, as immunity wanes over time, sporozoites can infect the liver and lead to blood-stage clinical malaria.
The development of a blood-stage malaria vaccine like RH5.1/Matrix-M could provide a critical second line of defense and potentially replace existing vaccines.
“There are 11 other malaria vaccines in Phase II development, including pre-erythrocytic and blood-stage vaccines from manufacturers such as BioNTech, GSK, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Vac4All SAS,” Kurdach said.
However, she added, “No new malaria vaccines are currently in Phase III development or pre-registration.”

Title: Sensex drops 964 points after US Fed’s hawkish stance on rate cuts
Publication Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:39:22 +0000
Content: Indian equity markets faced a steep decline on Thursday, closing in the red amid weak global cues. The sell-off was primarily triggered by the US Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance on interest rates, which led to a major shift in expectations for 2025. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) slashed the number of rate cuts anticipated for next year, fueling concerns about the economic outlook.
At the close of trading, the Sensex stood at 79,218.05, down by 964.15 points, or 1.20 percent. The Nifty 50 settled at 23,951.70, losing 247.15 points, or 1.02 percent.
Market experts noted a broad-based decline in Indian stocks, largely reflecting the global sell-off following the Fed’s decision. The sectors most sensitive to interest rates, notably banking and real estate, were among the hardest hit.
Despite the widespread market weakness, there was a slight reprieve due to the Bank of Japan’s surprise decision to keep interest rates unchanged, which helped reduce some of the selling pressure. However, investor sentiment remained cautious, with ongoing Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) selling prompting a shift towards defensive sectors like pharma. This trend was reflected in the outperformance of pharmaceutical and healthcare stocks, which showed resilience amid the broader market decline.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the broader market saw 1,684 stocks end in the green, while 2,309 closed in the red. A total of 102 stocks saw no change in their prices.
Among the sectoral indices, the biggest losses were in IT, metal, and energy stocks. On the flip side, pharma and healthcare stocks attracted some buying interest.
Within the Sensex pack, top losers included Bajaj Finserv, JSW Steel, Bajaj Finance, Asian Paints, ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries, TCS, Infosys, Tata Motors, and Mahindra & Mahindra. Meanwhile, Sun Pharma, Hindustan Unilever, and Power Grid emerged as the top gainers.

Title: One Nation, One Election: A proposal whose time has come
Publication Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:39:01 +0000
Content: For a nation of over 1.4 billion people and the world’s third-largest economy in the making, being in a perpetual election mode is not ideal. The ‘One Nation, One Election’ bill, which began its parliamentary journey earlier this week in the Lok Sabha, aims to end this endless loop of elections we find ourselves in as a nation.
The government, referring the bill to the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC), has ushered in an opportunity for an open conversation around the subject. With the next Lok Sabha polls scheduled in 2029, more than four years from now, the Modi government has the license to be liberal with their timeline. Therefore, to confuse the referring of the bill to the JPC as some diversionary tactic would be incorrect.
The first reaction from the Congress and other regional parties in the opposition is grounded in fictitious fabrication. To say that ‘One Nation, One Election’ is against the spirit of federalism is akin to saying that India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, won the elections that were not federal in nature.
The opposition MPs, especially the ones from the Congress, who are using the bill to label the Prime Minister as a dictator, must introspect, for their hastily crafted argument will boomerang strongly against their party’s history.
From 1951-52 to 1967, India witnessed simultaneous elections across four Lok Sabha polls. The disruption came in 1968 and 1969, as some state assemblies were prematurely dissolved. Put simply, ‘One Nation, One Election’ is not a new beginning; rather, it is a pursuit of the original idea that was executed in the dawn of our young Republic.
However, beyond history, the simultaneous elections in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, and Sikkim, alongside the Lok Sabha polls, are a testament to the thriving federalism in India. The state of Maharashtra has witnessed six simultaneous elections, while Haryana has witnessed five, and Jharkhand, one of the youngest states in India, has seen three simultaneous elections.
Another myth, that of the tenure of the state assemblies, must be addressed. Some MPs in the Lok Sabha were quick to point out that the bill is against the basic structure of the Constitution, for it reduces the term of the state assembly to less than five years. That is, in order to synchronize the state and national elections, some assemblies will witness tenures that will be shorter than five years. They are not even remotely correct.
Merely a cursory reading of Articles 83 and 172 can dispel this myth. Our Constitutional framers had carefully drafted the articles on the duration of the terms of the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha, unless dissolved early, to be of five years and no longer. Thus, the Constitution does have room for discussion on this aspect as well.
The Ram Nath Kovind Committee Report talks about the insertion of an additional article 82A through a constitutional amendment to alter the duration of the state assemblies in order to synchronize their term with the Lok Sabha. A series of constitutional amendments, dealing with the duration of the Lok Sabha and the state assemblies, duration of the assemblies in three Union Territories (Puducherry, Delhi, and Jammu and Kashmir), elections in urban and rural wards, and a single electoral roll will have to pass the numbers test in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The constitutional reasoning is sound on ‘One Nation, One Election’, and the only stress test will be on the floor of the Houses for the government.
One of the underrated, yet critical, proposals of the bill is the single electoral roll. The committee proposed that the simultaneous elections must allow for the synchronization of operations of the Election Commission and several state election commissions for the preparation of a single electoral roll, with the introduction of EPIC or Elector’s Photo Identity Card. This will not only replace the conventional voter card but also eliminate redundancy in voting, thus creating a self-correction mechanism.
For long, polity has superseded policy in India. Our governance, policymaking, and infrastructural push are directly and indirectly influenced by the elections across India. In the implementation of the Model Code of Conduct, critical time is lost, both of the government officials and the central forces that are deployed. Within India’s five-year electoral cycle, there does not exist a window of even eighteen months where governance can go on unperturbed.
Going back to simultaneous elections will eliminate policy paralysis and consequently offer more stability in governance, which will have a progressive impact on investments, infrastructure, and overall growth. Voter fatigue, that is now prevalent amongst several urban pockets, can also be addressed via simultaneous elections.
The challenge in simultaneous elections is not for the voters or the Election Commissions, but the participating parties, for they will have to evolve their campaigning style. While the voters will have the luxury of choosing from the best of both worlds, parties running a governance-based agenda will stand to gain.
However, parties like the Congress that thrive on contradictory dynamics at the state and national level may find it troublesome to adapt. The selective convenience with which Rahul Gandhi operates the alliances of the Congress may no longer be acceptable to its junior partners in the state.
Taking a cue from the BJD, which swept Odisha in 2014 and 2019 state elections, while the BJP swept the Lok Sabha, regional parties must be careful in evaluating the idea of simultaneous elections.
Elections must be about voting for a roadmap, one that dictates the country’s economy for the short term while having a direct impact on its long-term growth. The current alignment, though, appears to be a roadmap with multiple pauses on the way. Elections are integral to the democracy we are, but for the larger interests of the voters and of the elected governments, it is time we start considering a model that leaves more room for policy and considerably less for politicking. Early days in this journey, but perhaps, this is an idea whose time has come.

Title: India’s coal imports decline amid surge in domestic production
Publication Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:13:35 +0000
Content: India’s coal imports dropped by 3.1% during the April-October period of FY 2024-25, falling to 149.39 million tonnes (MT) from 154.17 MT in the same period last year, according to a statement released by the Ministry of Coal on Thursday.
The non-regulated sector (excluding power) saw an even sharper decline in imports, registering an 8.8% decrease during the same period.
Despite a 3.87% growth in coal-based power generation between April and October 2024 compared to the previous year, imports for blending purposes by thermal power plants saw a significant reduction of 19.5%. This decline reflects India’s ongoing efforts to increase self-reliance in coal production, the ministry noted.
However, coal imports for imported coal-based power plants surged by 38.4%, rising to 30.04 MT from 21.71 MT during the same period last year.
On the domestic front, coal production showed strong growth, increasing to 537.57 MT during April-October 2024, up 6.04% from 506.93 MT in the corresponding period of FY 2023-24. The ministry highlighted this rise as a sign of the government’s commitment to boosting domestic coal output and reducing reliance on imports.

Title: Auto PLI achieves ₹20,715 crore investment, ₹10,472 crore incremental sales: Centre
Publication Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:08:29 +0000
Content: The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for the automobile and auto components industry, initiated in 2021, has achieved investments worth ₹20,715 crore and incremental sales of ₹10,472 crore by September, the Ministry of Heavy Industries said.
Covering FY 2023-24 to FY 2027-28, the scheme targets advanced automotive technologies with incentives of 13-18% for EV and hydrogen fuel cell components and 8-13% for other technologies. The initiative expects ₹42,500 crore in investments and 1.4 lakh new jobs over five years.
According to the Ministry of Heavy Industries, under the FAME-II scheme, launched in 2019, ₹8,844 crore has been utilized to incentivize 16.15 lakh EVs and establish 10,985 public charging stations as of October 31. The scheme supports the adoption of various types of EVs and promotes the transition to sustainable transportation.
The PM E-DRIVE scheme, introduced in September 2024, aims to enhance EV infrastructure with a budget of ₹10,900 crore. It includes subsidies for EV purchases, e-bus procurement, and fast-charging infrastructure. By November, ₹332 crore had been disbursed under the scheme.
The Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Electric Passenger Cars (SMEC) launched in March, supports EV manufacturing by encouraging domestic value addition and capped imports of electric passenger cars at reduced customs duty.
The PM e-Bus Sewa Payment Security Mechanism, implemented in October, ensures payment security for e-bus operators through a ₹3,435.33 crore financial allocation.
To develop India’s battery manufacturing capacity, the PLI scheme for Advanced Chemistry Cell (ACC) battery storage was rolled out with a ₹18,100 crore outlay. By 2024, it facilitated the establishment of a 30 GWh battery manufacturing capacity, with investments amounting to ₹1,505 crore.
Other achievements include developing high-voltage motor controllers for EVs, energy-efficient components, and battery testing facilities. The Ministry also introduced the Industry 4.0 Maturity Model to assist MSMEs in adopting modern manufacturing technologies.

Title: Empowering farmers through PM-AASHA: A step towards economic resilience
Publication Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 10:40:33 +0000
Content: The Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare has implemented key initiatives to boost farmers’ income, with the Government’s Minimum Support Price (MSP) policy ensuring fair prices for major agricultural commodities.
This encourages higher investments in farming, boosting both production and productivity.
In the Rabi season of 2023-24, the government procured 6.41 LMT of pulses, benefiting 2.75 lakh farmers.
This procurement, part of the Pradhan Mantri Annadata Aay Sanrakshan Abhiyan (PM-AASHA), provides crucial price support for pulses, oilseeds, and copra, offering financial stability and protecting small and marginal farmers from market volatility.
Launched in 2018, PM-AASHA safeguards farmers through MSP and addresses post-harvest distress with schemes like the Price Support Scheme (PSS), Price Deficiency Payment Scheme (PDPS), and Market Intervention Scheme (MIS).
These measures promote crop diversification, fair pricing, and reduce the burden on farmers facing unfavourable market conditions.
In 2024, the government further pushed for Atmanirbharta (self-reliance) in pulses by lifting procurement ceilings for key crops like Tur, Urad, and Masoor.
Under PSS, 5.62 LMT of soybeans were procured during the Kharif season, benefiting over 2.42 lakh farmers. Rabi oilseeds procurement reached 12.19 LMT, helping 5.29 lakh farmers.
Since its inception, PM-AASHA has benefited 99.30 lakh farmers through the procurement of 195.39 LMT of pulses, oilseeds, and copra at an MSP value of Rs. 1,07,433.73 crore.
Through PDPS and MIS, PM-AASHA extends support to price-sensitive crops like tomatoes, onions, and potatoes, ensuring fair compensation when market prices drop.
These schemes bridge the price gap between production and consumption markets, protecting farmers from volatile market conditions.
PM-AASHA demonstrates the government’s commitment to empowering farmers, ensuring stable incomes, and promoting inclusive rural growth.
By stabilizing market prices and reducing dependence on intermediaries, the scheme offers small and marginal farmers a reliable safety net, helping them navigate market uncertainties and secure their livelihoods.

Title: International Olympic Committee reveals manifestos of presidency candidates
Publication Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 10:18:30 +0000
Content: The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has released the manifestos of seven candidates vying to succeed Thomas Bach as president in March 2025. Among them are Sebastian Coe, Prince Feisal Al Hussein, and Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr., each presenting distinct visions for the future of the Olympic movement.
Sebastian Coe, a 68-year-old Briton and current president of World Athletics, emphasizes the need for organizational reform within the IOC. He argues that decision-making power is overly centralized and advocates for a more inclusive approach that leverages the extensive expertise of IOC members. Coe’s manifesto underscores his lifelong dedication to sport and his commitment to enhancing the organization’s effectiveness. He also highlights the role of sport as a potent social force and expresses a firm stance on protecting the female category in athletics, referencing recent controversies in boxing as cautionary examples.
Prince Feisal Al Hussein of Jordan, aged 61, focuses on democratizing the IOC by amplifying member input and decentralizing decision-making processes. He proposes revising the Olympic Games schedule to accommodate climate variations, thereby enabling a broader range of host cities to bid. His manifesto also addresses the integration of esports into the Olympic framework, advocating for collaboration rather than competition with this emerging genre. Prince Feisal emphasizes the importance of engaging youth continuously throughout the Olympic cycle and suggests harnessing artificial intelligence to enhance the accessibility and enjoyment of sports.
Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr., a 65-year-old Spaniard and son of former IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch, calls for a comprehensive operational review of the IOC to ensure alignment with its mission and optimize resource utilization. He advocates for extending the retirement age of IOC members to retain valuable experience and suggests that members should have a decisive role in host city selections. Samaranch Jr. also proposes adjusting the Olympic calendar to accommodate regions affected by extreme heat, drawing parallels to the scheduling of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. He emphasizes the need for clear policies to protect women’s sports and maintain the organization’s political neutrality.
These candidates, each with substantial experience in sports administration, present varied strategies to guide the IOC into its next chapter, focusing on inclusivity, modernization, and the preservation of the Olympic spirit.

He assured that all required resources would be provided to achieve this aim, in line with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “zero tolerance policy” against terrorism.
Shah emphasized the need to implement the “area domination plan” and “zero terror plan” with focused efforts to eradicate terrorism from the region. He said that the government, along with all security forces, is determined to establish complete control over terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir.
Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah also participated in the meeting with Home Minister Amit Shah.
Following the meeting, Abdullah spoke to reporters about the ongoing discussion around the restoration of Jammu and Kashmir’s statehood. He stated that matters of law and order and security currently lie under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant Governor.
“The discussion with the Home Minister included the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and the restoration of statehood. There is hope that statehood will be restored. At present, law and order, as well as security, are under the Lieutenant Governor’s responsibility. I conveyed to the Home Minister that tackling terrorism and militancy requires involving the people of Jammu and Kashmir and consulting elected representatives,” he said.
Earlier in the day, security forces neutralized five militants in Kulgam district during an operation. Two soldiers sustained injuries and were evacuated for medical treatment. The Indian Army’s Chinar Corps stated that the operation occurred in the Kader area of Kulgam, where militants opened fire on security personnel.

Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on the occasion of Goa Liberation Day, paid tribute to the valiant women and men whose determination and sacrifices led to the region’s freedom from Portuguese rule.
In a post on X, PM Modi said, “Today, on Goa Liberation Day, we recall the bravery and determination of the great women and men who were actively involved in the movement to free Goa. Their valour motivates us to keep working for the betterment of Goa and the prosperity of the people of the state.”
President Droupadi Murmu also extended heartfelt gratitude to the freedom fighters and armed forces, acknowledging their pivotal roles in liberating Goa from colonial oppression.
“On Goa Liberation Day, the nation pays tribute to bravehearts who made selfless sacrifices for the liberation of Goa from colonial rule. We salute the fearless freedom fighters and our armed forces for their exceptional courage and unwavering dedication. I extend warm wishes to the people of Goa and wish them a prosperous future,” the President said.
Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant expressed pride in the state’s journey and called on citizens to continue striving toward a better future.
“Today, we honor the progressive journey of Goa’s development and the strides we’ve made towards achieving our dream of a ‘Golden Goa.’ The sacrifices and efforts of our revolutionary freedom fighters will always be remembered and cherished. I salute the brave soldiers of the Indian Armed Forces who led ‘Operation Vijay’ and liberated Goa from centuries of colonial oppression. Let us work together toward the betterment of our state, aligning with the vision of Swayampurna and a Viksit Goa,” Sawant said.

Title: Bangladesh’s largest conglomerate Beximco lays off 40,000 RMG workers:
Publication Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 14:19:11 +0000
Content: In Bangladesh, the Beximco Group, country’s largest conglomerate has laid off nearly 40,000 Ready Made Garment (RMG) workers across its 15 apparel units, citing a lack of work orders for its export-oriented garment and textile factories in Dhaka’s outskirts of Gazipur.
The Company notifications issued on December 15 informed all officials, employees and workers that the factories would enforce layoffs from December 16. The decision threatens the livelihoods of 40,000 RMG workers as the conglomerate struggles to manage escalating financial pressures.
According to the Business Standard newspaper of Bangladesh, Osman Kaiser Chowdhury, a director of Beximco Group and managing director of Beximco Limited, described the situation as unsustainable.
“We were initially assured by the interim government that our businesses would be supported. Based on this, we kept the factories operational for four months. However, no support materialised,” he said, explaining the rationale behind the impending layoffs.
The lack of fresh orders since August has compounded the challenges. Osman said major global buyers have signalled willingness to resume business if the group could secure Letters of Credit (LCs) from banks. However, the banking sector’s reluctance to support Beximco, due to its financial position, has left the company unable to fulfil these requirements, writes the Business Standard.
Beximco’s financial troubles are closely tied to its mounting debt. A recent report submitted by the Bangladesh Bank to the High Court revealed that the group’s loans stood at over Tk50,000 crore as of 30 November 2024, with over 50% – Tk25,524 crore – classified as defaulted. Out of the group’s 188 companies, 78 have borrowed from 16 banks and seven financial institutions.
The crisis at Beximco has broader political implications. Salman F Rahman, vice-chairman of the group, served as an adviser to ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina on private industry and investment.
During his tenure, critics allege, he leveraged his influence to secure favourable terms for Beximco, including extensive bank loans. Salman was arrested on 13 August from Sadarghat area in Dhaka and now in jail.
With the group now under financial and operational strain, the fallout from its debt crisis may extend far beyond its apparel factories, raising concerns about broader implications for Bangladesh’s banking and industrial sectors, according to bankers.

Title: Putin says Russia is ready to compromise with Trump on Ukraine war
Publication Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 12:02:47 +0000
Content: President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that he was ready to compromise over Ukraine in possible talks with Donald Trump on ending the war and that Russian forces were moving towards achieving their primary goals on the battlefield.
Trump, a self-styled master of brokering agreements and author of the 1987 book “Trump: the Art of the Deal”, has vowed to swiftly end the conflict, but has not yet given any details on how he might achieve that.
Putin, fielding questions on state TV during his annual question and answer session with Russians, told a reporter for a U.S. news channel that he was ready to meet Trump, whom he said he had not spoken to for years.
Asked what he might be able to offer Trump, Putin dismissed an assertion that Russia was in a weak position, saying that Russia had got much stronger since he ordered troops into Ukraine in 2022.
“We have always said that we are ready for negotiations and compromises,” Putin said after saying that Russian forces, advancing across the entire front, were moving towards achieving their primary goals in Ukraine.
“Soon, those Ukrainians who want to fight will run out, in my opinion, soon there will be no one left who wants to fight. We are ready, but the other side needs to be ready for both negotiations and compromises.”
Reuters reported last month that Putin was open to discussing a Ukraine ceasefire deal with Trump, but ruled out making any major territorial concessions and insisted Kyiv abandon its ambitions to join NATO.
Russia, he said, had made proposals to Syria’s new rulers about Russia’s military bases there and most people that Moscow had spoken to on the issue favoured them staying.
He said Russia would need to think about whether the bases should remain or not, but that rumours about the death of Russian influence in the Middle East were exaggerated.
Asked about the fate of missing U.S. reporter Austin Tice, who was kidnapped in Syria in 2012, Putin said he planned to speak to former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad and the new leaders of Syria about the issue. Tice’s family wrote to Putin asking for his help in finding Tice.
War
Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine has left tens of thousands of dead, displaced millions and triggered the biggest crisis in relations between Moscow and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.
Russia, which controls around a fifth of Ukraine, has taken several thousand square kilometres of territory in Ukraine this year, taking village after village and threatening strategically important cities such as Pokrovsk, a major road and rail hub.
Putin said the fighting was complex, so it was “difficult and pointless to guess what lies ahead… (but) we are moving, as you said, towards solving our primary tasks, which we outlined at the beginning of the special military operation.”
On the economy, Putin said it was showing signs of overheating which was stoking worryingly high inflation.
Discussing the continued presence of Ukrainian forces in Russia’s Kursk region, Putin said Kyiv’s troops would definitely be forced out, but declined to say exactly when that would happen.
Putin also touted what he said was the invincibility of the “Oreshnik” hypersonic missile which Russia has already test-fired at a Ukrainian military factory, saying he was ready to organise another launch at Ukraine and see if Western air defence systems could shoot it down.
“Let them determine some target for destruction, say in Kyiv, concentrate all their air defence and missile defence forces there, and we will strike there with Oreshnik and see what happens. We are ready for such an experiment, but is the other side ready?” he said.

Title: First malaria vaccine shows promise amid rising cases: report
Publication Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:39:58 +0000
Content: The first blood-stage malaria vaccine, RH5.1/Matrix-M, has shown promise as a potential component in an evolving malaria vaccine strategy, according to a report released on Thursday.
The report by GlobalData, a data and analytics company, revealed that 11 other malaria vaccines are currently in Phase II development.
A recent study conducted by researchers in Burkina Faso and the UK found that RH5.1/Matrix-M is safe, effective, and highly immunogenic.
The double-blind, randomized, controlled Phase 2b trial involved 361 children aged 5 to 17 months. The findings demonstrated that RH5.1/Matrix-M is 55% effective against clinical malaria when administered in a delayed third-dose regimen at 0, 1, and 5 months.
Moreover, the vaccine exhibited over 80% efficacy against high levels of malaria parasites, suggesting its potential to prevent severe disease. The trial, published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases, also confirmed that RH5.1/Matrix-M was generally safe and well-tolerated, with no serious adverse events reported.
“RH5.1/Matrix-M has the potential to be the first blood-stage malaria vaccine brought to market. This could serve as a vital addition to existing malaria vaccines and offer an important second line of defense for those most at risk,” said Stephanie Kurdach, Infectious Disease Analyst at GlobalData.
Malaria, a mosquito-borne disease caused by Plasmodium protozoans, is primarily transmitted through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Symptoms can range from fever, chills, and headaches to severe manifestations such as confusion, seizures, and difficulty breathing.
Despite progress, including some nations being certified as malaria-free, the disease remains a significant burden, particularly in the World Health Organization’s (WHO) African Region, Kurdach noted.
Currently, only two malaria vaccines are WHO-prequalified and recommended for use in children: GSK’s Mosquirix and Serum Institute of India’s R21/Matrix-M. These vaccines target the early sporozoite stage of the parasite to intercept infection. However, as immunity wanes over time, sporozoites can infect the liver and lead to blood-stage clinical malaria.
The development of a blood-stage malaria vaccine like RH5.1/Matrix-M could provide a critical second line of defense and potentially replace existing vaccines.
“There are 11 other malaria vaccines in Phase II development, including pre-erythrocytic and blood-stage vaccines from manufacturers such as BioNTech, GSK, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), and Vac4All SAS,” Kurdach said.
However, she added, “No new malaria vaccines are currently in Phase III development or pre-registration.”

Title: Sensex drops 964 points after US Fed’s hawkish stance on rate cuts
Publication Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:39:22 +0000
Content: Indian equity markets faced a steep decline on Thursday, closing in the red amid weak global cues. The sell-off was primarily triggered by the US Federal Reserve’s hawkish stance on interest rates, which led to a major shift in expectations for 2025. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) slashed the number of rate cuts anticipated for next year, fueling concerns about the economic outlook.
At the close of trading, the Sensex stood at 79,218.05, down by 964.15 points, or 1.20 percent. The Nifty 50 settled at 23,951.70, losing 247.15 points, or 1.02 percent.
Market experts noted a broad-based decline in Indian stocks, largely reflecting the global sell-off following the Fed’s decision. The sectors most sensitive to interest rates, notably banking and real estate, were among the hardest hit.
Despite the widespread market weakness, there was a slight reprieve due to the Bank of Japan’s surprise decision to keep interest rates unchanged, which helped reduce some of the selling pressure. However, investor sentiment remained cautious, with ongoing Foreign Institutional Investor (FII) selling prompting a shift towards defensive sectors like pharma. This trend was reflected in the outperformance of pharmaceutical and healthcare stocks, which showed resilience amid the broader market decline.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), the broader market saw 1,684 stocks end in the green, while 2,309 closed in the red. A total of 102 stocks saw no change in their prices.
Among the sectoral indices, the biggest losses were in IT, metal, and energy stocks. On the flip side, pharma and healthcare stocks attracted some buying interest.
Within the Sensex pack, top losers included Bajaj Finserv, JSW Steel, Bajaj Finance, Asian Paints, ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries, TCS, Infosys, Tata Motors, and Mahindra & Mahindra. Meanwhile, Sun Pharma, Hindustan Unilever, and Power Grid emerged as the top gainers.

Title: One Nation, One Election: A proposal whose time has come
Publication Date: Thu, 19 Dec 2024 11:39:01 +0000
Content: For a nation of over 1.4 billion people and the world’s third-largest economy in the making, being in a perpetual election mode is not ideal. The ‘One Nation, One Election’ bill, which began its parliamentary journey earlier this week in the Lok Sabha, aims to end this endless loop of elections we find ourselves in as a nation.
The government, referring the bill to the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC), has ushered in an opportunity for an open conversation around the subject. With the next Lok Sabha polls scheduled in 2029, more than four years from now, the Modi government has the license to be liberal with their timeline. Therefore, to confuse the referring of the bill to the JPC as some diversionary tactic would be incorrect.
The first reaction from the Congress and other regional parties in the opposition is grounded in fictitious fabrication. To say that ‘One Nation, One Election’ is against the spirit of federalism is akin to saying that India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, won the elections that were not federal in nature.
The opposition MPs, especially the ones from the Congress, who are using the bill to label the Prime Minister as a dictator, must introspect, for their hastily crafted argument will boomerang strongly against their party’s history.
From 1951-52 to 1967, India witnessed simultaneous elections across four Lok Sabha polls. The disruption came in 1968 and 1969, as some state assemblies were prematurely dissolved. Put simply, ‘One Nation, One Election’ is not a new beginning; rather, it is a pursuit of the original idea that was executed in the dawn of our young Republic.
However, beyond history, the simultaneous elections in Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, and Sikkim, alongside the Lok Sabha polls, are a testament to the thriving federalism in India. The state of Maharashtra has witnessed six simultaneous elections, while Haryana has witnessed five, and Jharkhand, one of the youngest states in India, has seen three simultaneous elections.
Another myth, that of the tenure of the state assemblies, must be addressed. Some MPs in the Lok Sabha were quick to point out that the bill is against the basic structure of the Constitution, for it reduces the term of the state assembly to less than five years. That is, in order to synchronize the state and national elections, some assemblies will witness tenures that will be shorter than five years. They are not even remotely correct.
Merely a cursory reading of Articles 83 and 172 can dispel this myth. Our Constitutional framers had carefully drafted the articles on the duration of the terms of the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha, unless dissolved early, to be of five years and no longer. Thus, the Constitution does have room for discussion on this aspect as well.
The Ram Nath Kovind Committee Report talks about the insertion of an additional article 82A through a constitutional amendment to alter the duration of the state assemblies in order to synchronize their term with the Lok Sabha. A series of constitutional amendments, dealing with the duration of the Lok Sabha and the state assemblies, duration of the assemblies in three Union Territories (Puducherry, Delhi, and Jammu and Kashmir), elections in urban and rural wards, and a single electoral roll will have to pass the numbers test in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The constitutional reasoning is sound on ‘One Nation, One Election’, and the only stress test will be on the floor of the Houses for the government.
One of the underrated, yet critical, proposals of the bill is the single electoral roll. The committee proposed that the simultaneous elections must allow for the synchronization of operations of the Election Commission and several state election commissions for the preparation of a single electoral roll, with the introduction of EPIC or Elector’s Photo Identity Card. This will not only replace the conventional voter card but also eliminate redundancy in voting, thus creating a self-correction mechanism.
For long, polity has superseded policy in India. Our governance, policymaking, and infrastructural push are directly and indirectly influenced by the elections across India. In the implementation of the Model Code of Conduct, critical time is lost, both of the government officials and the central forces that are deployed. Within India’s five-year electoral cycle, there does not exist a window of even eighteen months where governance can go on unperturbed.
Going back to simultaneous elections will eliminate policy paralysis and consequently offer more stability in governance, which will have a progressive impact on investments, infrastructure, and overall growth. Voter fatigue, that is now prevalent amongst several urban pockets, can also be addressed via simultaneous elections.
The challenge in simultaneous elections is not for the voters or the Election Commissions, but the participating parties, for they will have to evolve their campaigning style. While the voters will have the luxury of choosing from the best of both worlds, parties running a governance-based agenda will stand to gain.
However, parties like the Congress that thrive on contradictory dynamics at the state and national level may find it troublesome to adapt. The selective convenience with which Rahul Gandhi operates the alliances of the Congress may no longer be acceptable to its junior partners in the state.
Taking a cue from the BJD, which swept Odisha in 2014 and 2019 state elections, while the BJP swept the Lok Sabha, regional parties must be careful in evaluating the idea of simultaneous elections.
Elections must be about voting for a roadmap, one that dictates the country’s economy for the short term while having a direct impact on its long-term growth. The current alignment, though, appears to be a roadmap with multiple pauses on the way. Elections are integral to the democracy we are, but for the larger interests of the voters and of the elected governments, it is time we start considering a model that leaves more room for policy and considerably less for politicking. Early days in this journey, but perhaps, this is an idea whose time has come.

This success reflects the work of the National Paralympic Committee of India and the investment being made in sports, particularly Para athletics, in the country. We have witnessed the impact major events can have and the legacy they can leave to make Para sports more visible and accessible to everyone. We believe this can happen in New Delhi, and we look forward to welcoming the world’s best athletes to India next year.”
In a statement, the National Paralympic Committee of India (NPC India) said, “NPC India is privileged to host the Para Athletics World Championships for the first time in India. This historic event marks a significant milestone in India’s journey to becoming a global sporting powerhouse and strengthens our bid to host the 2036 Olympic and Paralympic Games.”
This prestigious championship will not only elevate India’s position on the global sports map but also play a pivotal role in accelerating the Paralympic movement within the country. With a population of over 60 million persons with disabilities, this event is a crucial step in fostering inclusivity, empowering athletes, and expanding opportunities for athletes with disabilities.
“We are excited to welcome athletes, coaches, and officials from around the world to showcase India’s unparalleled growth in the field of Para sports. This event will serve as a testament to India’s development, aligning with the vision of a ‘New India,’ as emphasized by Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” the statement added.
Over 1,000 athletes from more than 100 nations participated in the last edition of the World Championships in Kobe, Japan, in May. China topped the medals table with 33 gold and 87 podium finishes, while India finished in the top six for the first time.

Title: Over 4 lakh jobs backlog for SC, ST, OBC filled since 2016: Centre
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 07:10:52 +0000
Content: More than four lakh backlog vacancies in government jobs reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC), Scheduled Tribe (ST) and Other Backward Class (OBC) candidates have been filled since 2016, the Parliament was informed.
“Occurrence and filling of vacancies, including the backlog reserved vacancies, is a continuous process,” Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha.
Instructions have been issued to all ministries and departments of the central government to constitute an in-house committee for identification of backlog reserved vacancies, to study the root cause of such vacancies, to initiate measures to remove the factors causing such vacancies and to fill them up including through special recruitment drives, the minister said.
The minister said each ministry/department of the central government is required to designate an officer of the rank of Deputy Secretary and above, as Liaison Officer, to ensure due compliance of the orders and instructions pertaining to reservation.
Each ministry/department is also required to set up a special reservation cell to assist the Liaison Officer.
In an answer to another question, the minister also said that the Government has undertaken the ‘Initiative for Increasing Efficiency in Decision Making in Government’ in alignment with the policy of ‘Minimum Government, Maximum Governance’.
The initiative for increasing efficiency in decision making, incorporated into the Central Secretariat Manual of Office Procedure, adopted a four pronged approach with focus on delayering, delegation, digitization and desk officer system was implemented in all Ministries/Departments. In November 2024, the Government has issued directions to review the levels of disposal and channels of submission in Ministries/Departments and ensure that the levels do not exceed four.
Mission Karmayogi is an initiative of the central government to enhance the attitudes, skills and knowledge of the Government employees. The mission targets to build capacity on domain, functional as well as behavioral competencies.
A key feature of the Mission is the digital learning platform , IGOT Karmayogi, which provides more than 1500 courses to help civil servants upgrade their skills in governance, policy implementation, and technology. It promotes ensuring more efficient public service delivery and helps foster efficiency, accountability and transparency in the public service, Singh explained.

Title: India’s Renewable Energy Sector Attracts Record Investment in 2023
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 06:48:09 +0000
Content: A new report by the Centre for Financial Accountability reveals that project finance flowing into India’s renewable energy sector surged by 63% in 2023, reaching Rs 30,255 crore ($3.66 billion) compared to 2022 figures.
The report, titled ‘Coal vs RE Investment in 2024’, highlights that while project finance lending to renewable energy projects has seen a significant rise, no new coal power projects received project finance lending for the third year running. However, corporate finance lending to coal power and mining companies did amount to $3 billion.
Solar power projects were the primary recipients of renewable energy investment in 2023, securing 49% of the total, followed by hybrid projects at 46% and wind energy at 6%. Joe Athialy, Executive Director of the Centre for Financial Accountability, commented, “We’ve consistently seen an increase in project finance to solar and wind power projects. This shows there is investor confidence in renewable power projects.”
In contrast, over 96% of coal-linked company financing from commercial banks in India was facilitated through underwriting in 2023, with loans constituting just 4%. Notably, US-based banks provided the majority 65% of corporate financing to coal-linked companies.
According to the report, India achieved 188 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity in 2023. Of the project deals, 77% were primary financing, with the remaining 23% comprising refinancing. Commercial banks contributed 68% of renewable energy loans, totalling Rs 20,625 crore ($2,497 million).
Gujarat led the way in attracting renewable energy investment, receiving 25% of the financed capacity, equivalent to Rs 9,857 crore ($1,193 million). Karnataka followed with Rs 4,593 crore ($556 million).
Addressing the CII International Energy Conference and Exhibition (IECE), Union Minister Pralhad Joshi stated that India added nearly 15 GW of renewable energy capacity between April and November of the current financial year, almost double the 7.54 GW added during the same period last year.
He further noted that India’s total installed capacity in the non-fossil fuel energy sector has reached 214 GW, a rise of over 14% compared to the previous year. In November 2024 alone, 2.3 GW of new capacity was added, a four-fold increase from the 566 MW added in November 2023.
Minister Joshi reiterated the Government’s commitment to achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based capacity by 2030.

Title: Parliament Winter Session: Lok sabha adjourned sine die
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 06:40:14 +0000
Content: The Lok Sabha was adjourned sine die on Friday shortly after proceedings began, following a massive scuffle in Parliament the previous day. The Rajya Sabha was also adjourned until 12 noon.
Before the adjournment in the Lok Sabha, Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal moved a motion to refer two bills related to “One Nation, One Election” to a Joint Committee of both Houses. The motion, which listed 27 members from the Lok Sabha, was approved amid the din in the House. The committee will also include 12 members from the Rajya Sabha and is expected to submit its report to the Lok Sabha by the first day of the last week of the next session.
Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla emphasized that maintaining the dignity of Parliament is a collective responsibility. He stated that protests at any of the “dwars” (gates) of Parliament were inappropriate and warned that Parliament would take action in case of violations.
On Thursday morning, Parliament witnessed parallel protests by both the Treasury and Opposition benches outside the premises. BJP MPs protested against the Congress party, accusing it of “insulting” Babasaheb Ambedkar. Meanwhile, INDIA Bloc MPs, led by Rahul Gandhi, held a protest demanding Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s resignation over his remarks on Ambedkar.
Leaders from both sides alleged pushing and shoving during the protests. Two BJP MPs, Pratap Sarangi and Mukesh Rajput, sustained injuries and were admitted to Delhi’s Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.
Union Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan later accused Rahul Gandhi of behaving like a “goon” and intentionally disrupting the BJP MPs’ protest at the Makar Dwar of Parliament, leading to the scuffle. Addressing a press conference at the BJP headquarters, Chouhan criticized Congress leaders Mallikarjun Kharge and Rahul Gandhi, accusing them of a lack of accountability and respect.
Earlier on Friday, Congress MP K Suresh submitted an adjournment motion notice in the Lok Sabha regarding Amit Shah’s alleged controversial remarks about former Law Minister and Constitution architect Dr. B.R. Ambedkar.
The notice stated: “I hereby give notice of my intention to ask for leave to move a motion for the adjournment of the business of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent importance.”
Suresh added that Shah’s remarks, made during the 75th-anniversary celebrations of the Indian Constitution, belittled Ambedkar’s contributions, calling them “political symbolism” and undermining the values of justice, equality, and dignity that Ambedkar championed.
He further emphasized: “Dr. Ambedkar’s legacy is not confined to any political party; it belongs to the entire nation.” Suresh called for an unconditional apology from the Home Minister and urged the House to affirm its commitment to respecting national heroes.
On Thursday, Suresh had also submitted an adjournment motion notice in the Lok Sabha, expressing “grave concern” over Shah’s comments, which he described as “deeply disrespectful and hurtful” to those who revere Ambedkar.
Shah had reportedly stated in the Rajya Sabha: “If they had taken the name of God so many times instead of Ambedkar, they would have got heaven for seven lives.” (ANI)

Title: India 39th among 119 nations in WEF tourism development index, improves 2021 ranking
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 06:33:02 +0000
Content: Driven by improved infrastructure and friendly government policies to boost tourism, India is now ranked 39th among 119th countries in the Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI) 2024 report, published by the World Economic Forum (WEF).
In the previous index published in 2021, India was ranked 54th. However, due to a revision in the WEF’s methodology, India’s 2021 rank was adjusted to 38th place, Union Minister for Tourism and Culture, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, said in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha.
The Ministry of Tourism, under the schemes of ‘Swadesh Darshan’, ‘National Mission on Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Heritage Augmentation Drive (PRASHAD)’ and ‘Assistance to Central Agencies for Tourism Infrastructure Development’, provides financial assistance to state governments, Union Territory administrations, Central agencies for the development of tourism-related infrastructure and facilities at various tourism destinations in the country.
The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched India’s official portal for Medical Value Travel (MVT), which is the Advantage Healthcare India portal.
It is a “One-Stop” portal developed for the facilitation of information for those who want to avail medical treatment in India from abroad.
Earlier this week, President Droupadi Murmu said that India is emerging as a major centre for affordable medical tourism on the global stage, and doctors in the country play a significant role in this development.
“India is developing as a major centre of affordable medical tourism on the world stage and doctors have a major role in this development. People from other countries visit India to take advantage of the medical facilities available here,” Murmu said.
According to Shekhawat, with over 5,000 years of civilisational history, 43 World Heritage Sites, 56 potential World Heritage Sites, and around 3,500 monuments of national importance, “India’s cultural heritage stands as a testament to its global strength.”
Speaking at the ‘Embracing Diversity: Promoting Inclusive Tourism’ session at ‘Rising Rajasthan’ summit recently, the minister said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision of ‘Virasat Bhi Vikas Bhi’ (heritage and development) has propelled the country’s progress, connecting India’s historical uniqueness with its modern achievements.

Title: US official cites Pakistan’s expanding missile programme as an ‘Emerging Threat’ to the United States
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 06:24:44 +0000
Content: A senior White House official stated on Thursday that nuclear-armed Pakistan is developing long-range ballistic missile capabilities that could eventually enable it to reach targets well beyond South Asia, potentially making it what he called an “emerging threat” to the United States.
Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer’s surprise revelation underscored how far the once-close ties between Washington and Islamabad have deteriorated since the 2021 U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan.
It also raised questions about whether Pakistan has broadened the aims of its nuclear and missile programmes, which were long intended to counter India.
The two nations have fought three major wars since their independence in 1947.
Speaking at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Finer noted that Pakistan has pursued increasingly advanced missile technology, ranging from long-range ballistic systems to equipment that would allow the testing of significantly larger rocket motors.
If these developments continue, he said, Pakistan would gain the ability to strike targets far beyond South Asia, including within the United States. The number of nuclear-armed states with missiles that can reach the U.S. homeland “is very small and they tend to be adversarial,” he continued, naming Russia, North Korea and China.
“So, candidly, it’s hard for us to see Pakistan’s actions as anything other than an emerging threat to the United States,” Finer said.
His remarks came one day after Washington announced a new round of sanctions related to Pakistan’s missile development efforts, including, for the first time, measures targeting the state-run defence agency overseeing those activities.
The Pakistani embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Islamabad describes its nuclear and missile programmes as essential deterrents against potential Indian aggression and as a means of maintaining regional stability.
Two senior US administration officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said concerns about Pakistan’s missile programme stemmed largely from the size of the rocket engines being developed.
The threat posed to the United States is up to a decade away, said one official.
They said Finer’s comments were intended to prompt Pakistani officials to explain the purpose behind developing more powerful rocket engines, an explanation Washington has yet to receive.
“They don’t acknowledge our concerns. They tell us we are biased,” said the second U.S. official, adding that Pakistani officials have wrongly implied that U.S. sanctions on their missile program are intended “to handicap their ability to defend against India.”
Finer noted that he and other senior US officials have repeatedly expressed concerns about the programme to top Pakistani officials, without any meaningful progress.
Washington and Islamabad have a long history of cooperation in development, counterterrorism, and security.
“That makes us question even more why Pakistan would be motivated to develop a capability that could be used against us,” Finer added.
Pakistan has criticised the close ties that US President Joe Biden has nurtured with India, its longstanding rival, and retains strong relations with China, some of whose entities have faced US sanctions for supplying Islamabad’s missile programme.
Pakistan conducted its first nuclear test in 1998, more than two decades after India’s initial nuclear test, and has built an extensive arsenal of ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads.
The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists estimates that Pakistan possesses about 170 warheads.
US-Pakistani relations have swung dramatically over the years. The two countries were close partners during the Cold War, supporting Afghan rebels against Soviet occupation from 1979 to 1989.
Pakistan was also a key partner in America’s fight against al Qaeda after the 11 September 2001 attacks and has held major non-NATO ally status since 2004.
However, ties have been undermined by military coups in Pakistan, its past support for the Taliban’s 1996-2001 regime in Afghanistan, and its nuclear ambitions.
Several experts said Finer’s speech came as a major surprise. “For a senior U.S. official to publicly link concerns about proliferation in Pakistan to a future direct threat to the U.S. homeland – this is a mighty dramatic development,” said Michael Kugelman of the Wilson Center think tank.

Title: Top US officials in Damascus to meet new Syrian rulers, State Department says
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 06:02:28 +0000
Content: Top diplomats from the Biden administration are in Damascus on Friday to meet new Syrian authorities led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a State Department spokesperson said, the first in-person and official meeting between Washington and Syria’s de-facto new rulers.
The State Department’s top Middle East diplomat Barbara Leaf, Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens and newly appointed Senior Advisor Daniel Rubinstein, who is now tasked with leading the Department’s Syria engagement, are the first U.S. diplomats to travel to Damascus since Syria’s opposition militias overthrew oppressive President Bashar al-Assad.
The visit comes as Western governments are gradually opening channels to HTS and its leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, and start debating whether or not to remove the terrorist designation on the group.
The U.S. delegation’s travel follows contacts with France and Britain in recent days.
In their meetings, the U.S. officials will discuss with HTS representatives a set of principles such as inclusivity and respect for the rights of minorities that Washington wants included in Syria’s political transition, the spokesperson said.
The delegation will also work to obtain new information about U.S. journalist Austin Tice, who was taken captive during a reporting trip to Syria in August 2012, and other American citizens who went missing during the Assad regime.
“They will be engaging directly with the Syrian people, including members of civil society, activists, members of different communities, and other Syrian voices about their vision for the future of their country and how the United States can help support them,” the department spokesperson said.
“They also plan to meet with representatives of HTS to discuss transition principles endorsed by the United States and regional partners in Aqaba, Jordan,” the spokesperson said.
The United States cut diplomatic ties with Syria and shut down its embassy in Damascus in 2012.
In a seismic moment for the Middle East, Syrian rebels seized control of Damascus on Dec. 8, forcing Assad to flee after more than 13 years of civil war, ending his family’s decades-long rule.
The lightning offensive raised questions over whether the rebels will be able to ensure an orderly transition.
Forces under the command of al-Sharaa – better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani replaced the Assad family rule with a three-month transitional government that had been ruling a rebel enclave in Syria’s northwestern province of Idlib.
Washington in 2013 designated al-Sharaa a terrorist, saying al Qaeda in Iraq had tasked him with overthrowing Assad’s rule and establishing Islamic sharia law in Syria.
It said the Nusra Front, the predecessor of HTS, carried out suicide attacks that killed civilians and espoused a violent sectarian vision.
U.S. President Joe Biden and his top aides described the overthrow of Assad as a historic opportunity for the Syrian people who have for decades lived under his oppressive rule, but also warned the country faced a period of risk and uncertainty.
Washington remains concerned that extremist group ISIS could seize the moment to resurrect and also wants to avoid any clashes in the country’s northeast between Turkey-backed rebel factions and U.S.-allied Kurdish militia.

Title: Israel’s Netanyahu eyes Iran after triumphs over Hamas, Hezbollah, Syria
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 05:32:31 +0000
Content: 2025 will be a year of reckoning for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his country’s arch foe Iran.
The veteran Israeli leader is set to cement his strategic goals: tightening his military control over Gaza, thwarting Iran’s nuclear ambitions and capitalising on the dismantling of Tehran’s allies — Palestinian Hamas, Lebanon’s Hezbollah and the removal of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.
Assad’s collapse, the elimination of the top leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah and the destruction of their military structure mark a succession of monumental wins for Netanyahu.
Without Syria, the alliances Tehran has nurtured for decades have unraveled. As Iran’s influence weakens, Israel is emerging as the dominant power in the region.
Netanyahu is poised to zero in on Iran’s nuclear ambitions and missile program, applying an unyielding focus to dismantling and neutralising these strategic threats to Israel.
Iran, Middle East observers say, faces a stark choice: Either continue its nuclear enrichment program or scale back its atomic activities and agree to negotiations.
“Iran is very vulnerable to an Israeli attack, particularly against its nuclear program,” said Joost R. Hiltermann, Middle East and North Africa Program Director of the International Crisis Group. “I wouldn’t be surprised if Israel did it, but that doesn’t get rid of Iran.”
“If they (Iranians) do not back down, Trump and Netanyahu might strike, as nothing now prevents them,” said Palestinian analyst Ghassan al-Khatib, referring to President-elect Donald Trump. Khatib argued that the Iranian leadership, having demonstrated pragmatism in the past, may be willing to compromise to avert a military confrontation.
Trump, who withdrew from a 2015 agreement between Iran and six world powers aimed at curbing Tehran’s nuclear goals, is likely to step up sanctions on Iran’s oil industry, despite calls to return to negotiations from critics who see diplomacy as a more effective long-term policy.
DEFINING LEGACY
Amid the turmoil of Iran and Gaza, Netanyahu’s long-running corruption trial, which resumed in December, will also play a defining role in shaping his legacy. For the first time since the outbreak of the Gaza war in 2023, Netanyahu took the stand in proceedings that have bitterly divided Israelis.
With 2024 coming to an end, the Israeli prime minister will likely agree to sign a ceasefire accord with Hamas to halt the 14-month-old Gaza war and free Israeli hostages held in the enclave, according to sources close to the negotiations.
But Gaza would stay under Israeli military control in the absence of a post-war U.S. plan for Israel to cede power to the Palestinian Authority (PA), which Netanyahu rejects. Arab states have shown little inclination to press Israel to compromise or push the decaying PA to overhaul its leadership to take over.
“Israel will remain in Gaza militarily in the foreseeable future because any withdrawal carries the risk of Hamas reorganising. Israel believes that the only way to maintain the military gains is to stay in Gaza,” Khatib told Reuters.
For Netanyahu, such a result would mark a strategic victory, consolidating a status quo that aligns with his vision: Preventing Palestinian statehood while ensuring Israel’s long-term control over Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem — territories internationally recognised as integral to a future Palestinian state.
The Gaza war erupted when Hamas militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel responded with an air and land offensive that has killed 45,000 people, health authorities there say, displaced 1.2 million and left much of the enclave in ruins.
While the ceasefire pact would bring an immediate end to the Gaza hostilities, it would not address the deeper, decades-old Palestinian-Israeli conflict, Arab and Western officials say.
On the ground, prospects for a Palestinian state, an option repeatedly ruled out by Netanyahu’s government, have become increasingly unattainable, with Israeli settler leaders optimistic that Trump will align closely with their views.
A surge in settler violence and the increasing confidence of the settler movement – highway billboards in some West Bank areas bear the message in Arabic “No Future in Palestine” – reflect a growing squeeze on Palestinians.
Even if the Trump administration were to push for an end to the conflict, “any resolution would be on Israel’s terms,” said Hiltermann of the Crisis Group.
“It’s over when it comes to a Palestinian state, but the Palestinians are still there,” he said.
In Trump’s previous term, Netanyahu secured several diplomatic wins, including the “Deal of the Century,” a U.S.-backed peace plan which Trump floated in 2020 to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The plan, if implemented, marks a dramatic shift in U.S. policy and international agreements by overtly aligning with Israel and deviating sharply from a long-standing land-for-peace framework that has historically guided negotiations.
It would allow Israel to annex vast stretches of land in the occupied West Bank, including Israeli settlements and the Jordan Valley. It would also recognise Jerusalem as the “undivided capital of Israel” – effectively denying Palestinian claims to East Jerusalem as their capital, a central aspiration in their statehood goals and in accordance with U.N. resolutions.
SYRIA AT CRITICAL CROSSROADS
Across the border from Israel, Syria stands at a critical juncture following the overthrow of Assad by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) rebel forces, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, better known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani.
Golani now faces the monumental task of consolidating control over a fractured Syria, where the military and police force have collapsed. HTS has to rebuild from scratch, securing borders and maintaining internal stability against threats from jihadists, remnants of the Assad regime, and other adversaries.
The greatest fear among Syrians and observers alike is whether HTS, once linked to al-Qaeda but now presenting itself as a Syrian nationalist force to gain legitimacy, reverts to a rigid Islamist ideology.
The group’s ability – or failure – to navigate this balance will shape the future of Syria, home to diverse communities of Sunnis, Shi’ites, Alawites, Kurds, Druze and Christians.
“If they succeed in that (Syrian nationalism) there’s hope for Syria, but if they revert to their comfort zone of quite strongly ideologically-tainted Islamism, then it’s going to be divisive in Syria,” said Hiltermann.
“You could have chaos and a weak Syria for a long time, just like we saw in Libya and Iraq.”

Title: Human Rights Watch says Israel’s deprivation of water in Gaza is act of genocide
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 05:27:54 +0000
Content: Human Rights Watch said on Thursday that Israel has killed thousands of Palestinians in Gaza by denying them clean water which it says legally amounts to acts of genocide and extermination.
“This policy, inflicted as part of a mass killing of Palestinian civilians in Gaza, means Israeli authorities have committed the crime against humanity of extermination, which is ongoing. This policy also amounts to an ‘act of genocide’ under the Genocide Convention of 1948,” Human Rights Watch said in its report.
Israel has repeatedly rejected any accusation of genocide, saying it has respected international law and has a right to defend itself after the cross-border Hamas-led attack from Gaza on Oct. 7, 2023 that precipitated the war.
In a statement on X, Israel’s foreign ministry wrote: “The truth is the complete opposite of HRW’s lies,” adding that Israel had enabled a continuous flow of water and aid into Gaza.
Although the report described the deprivation of water as an act of genocide, it noted that proving the crime of genocide against Israeli officials would also require establishing their intent. It cited statements by some senior Israeli officials which it said suggested they “wish to destroy Palestinians” which means the deprivation of water “may amount to the crime of genocide”.
“What we have found is that the Israeli government is intentionally killing Palestinians in Gaza by denying them the water that they need to survive,” Lama Fakih, Human Rights Watch Middle East director told a press conference.
In its response, Israel said it had ensured water infrastructure remained operational. It said international partners had sent water tankers through Israeli crossings, including last week, and ⁠Israel had facilitated the entry of more than 1.2 million tons of humanitarian supplies into Gaza.
The military said 2,500 trucks, carrying more than 51,000 tons of water, had gone into Gaza since the start of the war and it had established three water pipelines and facilitated two additional pipelines supplied by the United Arab Emirates.
In addition, a desalination plant with a capacity of 20,000 cubic metres of water a day in the southern city of Khan Yunis was in operation, an Israeli security source said.
Human Rights Watch is the second major rights group in a month to use the word genocide to describe the actions of Israel in Gaza, after Amnesty International issued a report that concluded Israel was committing genocide.
Both reports came just weeks after the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence chief for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. They deny the allegations.
The 1948 Genocide Convention, enacted in the wake of the mass murder of Jews in the Nazi Holocaust, defines the crime of genocide as “acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group”.
Human Rights Watch said Israel stopped water being piped into Gaza and cut off electricity and restricted fuel meaning Gaza’s own water and sanitation facilities could not be used.
Palestinians in Gaza had access to only a few litres of water a day in many areas, far below the 15-liter-threshold for survival, the group said.
Israel launched its campaignin Gaza after Hamas-led fighters attacked Israeli communities across the border 14 months ago, killing 1,200 people and taking over 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.
Israel’s campaign has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, displaced most of the 2.3 million population and reduced much of the coastal enclave to ruins.

Title: Trump-backed spending deal fails in House, shutdown approaches
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 05:07:33 +0000
Content: A spending bill backed by Donald Trump failed in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday as dozens of Republicans defied the president-elect, leaving Congress with no clear plan to avert a fast-approaching government shutdown that could disrupt Christmas travel.
The vote laid bare fault lines in Trump’s Republican Party that could surface again next year when they control the White House and both chambers of Congress.
Trump had pressured lawmakers to tie up loose ends before he takes office on Jan. 20, but members of the party’s right flank refused to support a package that would increase spending and clear the way for a plan that would add trillions more to the federal government’s $36 trillion in debt.
“I am absolutely sickened by a party that campaigns on fiscal responsibility and has the temerity to go to the American people and say you think this is fiscally responsible,” said Republican Representative Chip Roy, one of 38 Republicans who voted against the bill.
The package failed by a vote of 174-235 just hours after it was hastily assembled by Republican leaders seeking to comply with Trump’s demands. A prior bipartisan deal was scuttled after Trump and the world’s richest person Elon Musk came out against it on Wednesday.
Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson provided no details when reporters asked him about next steps after the failed vote.
“We will come up with another solution,” he said.
Government funding is due to expire at midnight on Friday. If lawmakers fail to extend that deadline, the U.S. government will begin a partial shutdown that would interrupt funding for everything from border enforcement to national parks and cut off paychecks for more than 2 million federal workers. The U.S. Transportation Security Administration warned that travelers during the busy holiday season could face long lines at airports.
The bill that failed on Thursday largely resembled the earlier version that Musk and Trump had blasted as a wasteful giveaway to Democrats. It would have extended government funding into March and provided $100 billion in disaster relief and suspended the debt. Republicans dropped other elements that had been included in the original package, such as a pay raise for lawmakers and new rules for pharmacy benefit managers.
At Trump’s urging, the new version also would have suspended limits on the national debt for two years — a maneuver that would make it easier to pass the dramatic tax cuts he has promised.
Johnson before the vote told reporters that the package would avoid disruption, tie up loose ends and make it easier for lawmakers to cut spending by hundreds of billions of dollars when Trump takes office next year.
“Government is too big, it does too many things, and it does few things well,” he said.
TEEING UP TAX CUT
Democrats blasted the bill as a cover for a budget-busting tax cut that would largely benefit wealthy backers such as Musk, the world’s richest person, while saddling the country with trillions of dollars in additional debt.
“How dare you lecture America about fiscal responsibility, ever?” House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said during floor debate.
Even if the bill had passed the House, it would have faced long odds in the Senate, which is currently controlled by Democrats. The White House said Democratic President Joe Biden did not support it.
Previous fights over the debt ceiling have spooked financial markets, as a U.S. government default would send credit shocks around the world. The limit has been suspended under an agreement that technically expires on Jan. 1, though lawmakers likely will not have to tackle the issue before the spring.
When he returns to office, Trump aims to enact tax cuts that could reduce revenues by $8 trillion over 10 years, which would drive the debt higher without offsetting spending cuts. He has vowed not to reduce retirement and health benefits for seniors that make up a vast chunk of the budget and are projected to grow dramatically in the years to come.
The last government shutdown took place in December 2018 and January 2019 during Trump’s first White House term.
The unrest also threatened to topple Johnson, a mild-mannered Louisianan who was thrust unexpectedly into the speaker’s office last year after the party’s right flank voted out then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy over a government funding bill. Johnson has repeatedly had to turn to Democrats for help in passing legislation when he has been unable to deliver the votes from his own party.
He tried the same maneuver on Thursday, but this time fell short.
Several Republicans said they would not vote for Johnson as speaker when Congress returns in January, potentially setting up another tumultuous leadership battle in the weeks before Trump takes office.

Title: PM Modi’s visit to Kuwait very significant, will take bilateral ties to new heights: Indian envoy Swaika
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 11:57:43 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s upcoming visit to Kuwait, scheduled for December 21-22, is set to significantly enhance bilateral relations between India and Kuwait, according to India’s Ambassador to Kuwait, Adarsh Swaika.
This visit, which marks a milestone after a gap of 43 years, is especially significant as it is the only country in the Gulf region that PM Modi has not visited so far. Additionally, it represents the first high-level visit between the two nations in the past decade, with the last visit by a Kuwaiti prime minister to India occurring in 2013.
In a statement to ANI, Ambassador Swaika highlighted the importance of the visit. “This visit is very significant, particularly in the context of three important facts. First, it is taking place after 43 years, second, it is the only Gulf country Prime Minister Modi had not visited yet, and third, it marks the first high-level visit in over a decade,” he said.
During his visit, PM Modi is expected to meet Kuwait’s leadership and engage with the large Indian expatriate community in Kuwait. The visit is seen as having strong symbolic value, with Ambassador Swaika noting that the outcomes will be “concrete” and will take India-Kuwait relations to new heights.
The Indian expatriate community in Kuwait plays a key role in strengthening the relationship between the two nations. India is the largest source of expatriates in Kuwait, and the community contributes significantly to the Kuwaiti economy through remittances. In fact, last year, Indian expatriates sent back $6.3 billion in remittances.
Swaika further emphasized the strong economic ties between India and Kuwait. “India is one of Kuwait’s top trading partners. Kuwait is the sixth-largest source of India’s crude oil imports, and India also supplies essential food products to Kuwait to help meet its food security needs,” he said. Bilateral trade has also seen substantial growth, reaching $2 billion for the first time last year, with many “Make in India” products being exported.
Additionally, investments from Kuwaiti companies, including the sovereign wealth fund Kuwait Investment Authority, are growing in India. On the other hand, Indian companies are actively involved in executing large-scale infrastructure projects in Kuwait, in line with Kuwait’s Vision 2035, a long-term development plan aimed at diversifying its economy.
Ambassador Swaika also said the increasing frequency of high-level diplomatic exchanges between the two nations in recent months. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar visited Kuwait in August, while Kuwait’s Foreign Minister visited India in December. Moreover, PM Modi met Kuwait’s Crown Prince in New York in September, further cementing the strong diplomatic ties.
In a press release, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) stated, “India and Kuwait have long enjoyed close and friendly relations, built on a shared history and strengthened by robust economic ties and strong people-to-people connections. India is one of Kuwait’s key trading partners, and the Indian community represents the largest expatriate group in the country. This visit offers a valuable opportunity to further enhance the diverse and dynamic relationship between the two nations.”

Title: Novo Nordisk shares plunge after CagriSema obesity drug trial disappoints
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 11:52:01 +0000
Content: Novo Nordisk said on Friday its experimental next-generation obesity drug CagriSema helped patients cut their weight by 22.7% in a late-stage trial, below the 25% it had expected, wiping as much as $125 billion off its market value.
The lower-than-expected weight loss from the drug candidate deals a blow to the Danish company’s ambitions for a successor to its popular Wegovy that is more powerful than Eli Lilly’s rival Zepbound, also known as Mounjaro.
Investors and analysts had eagerly awaited this data as a test of Novo’s case that it has a strong pipeline of drugs to follow Wegovy in the fiercely competitive anti-obesity market.
Novo’s share price fell as much as 27% after the results were announced on Friday, to their lowest since August 2023.
Shares in U.S. rival Lilly rose more than 7% in pre-market trade.
Novo said if all people adhered to treatment with CagriSema, patients overall achieved weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, with 40.4% losing 25% or more.
The data from the Phase III trial was based on about 3,400 people with a body mass index (BMI) of or above 30, or people with a BMI of 27 and at least one weight-related comorbidity like hypertension or cardiovascular disease.
Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for development, said Novo was “encouraged” by the data.
He said only 57% of patients in the trial reached the highest dose, adding: “With the insights obtained from the REDEFINE 1 trial, we plan to further explore the additional weight loss potential of CagriSema.”
Novo said the drug had similar side effects compared to its GLP-1 drugs already on the market. The most common adverse events with CagriSema were gastrointestinal, and the vast majority were mild to moderate and diminished over time, consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class, it said.
WEEKLY INJECTION
CagriSema is a weekly injection which combines semaglutide, which is the active ingredient in Wegovy and mimics the gut hormone GLP-1, and a separate molecule called cagrilintide that mimics the pancreatic hormone amylin, into a weekly injection.
The two hormones combined suppress hunger and help control patients’ blood glucose.
Novo’s trial is the most advanced for an amylin drug candidate currently being tested in the market.
The success of Wegovy helped make Novo Europe’s biggest company by market capitalisation, worth more than $460 billion. Its shares have been under pressure this year, however, significantly underperforming those of chief rival Lilly, due mainly to concerns Novo may be losing its first-mover advantage in the obesity drug race.
Lilly’s own obesity injection – sold as Zepbound in the United States and Mounjaro in other markets where it has launched – led to an average weight loss of nearly 23% in clinical trials.

Title: Indian stock markets decline over 1.4% amid global selloff
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 11:27:19 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market faced a sharp decline on Friday, shedding over 1,000 points, following indications from the US Federal Reserve of a cautious approach to interest rate cuts.
Major selling was observed in Nifty’s realty and PSU bank sectors. By the end of trading, the Sensex settled at 78,041.59, down 1,176.46 points, or 1.49%, while the Nifty closed at 23,587.50, declining 364.20 points, or 1.52%.
Krishna Appala from Capitalmind Research attributed the market’s current state to stock-specific trends, noting that broader indices appear to be pausing. He pointed to several influential factors, including the forthcoming US Presidential transition in January and the Union Budget announcement in India.
The Nifty Bank index ended at 50,759.20, a drop of 816.50 points, or 1.58%. The Nifty Midcap 100 index closed at 56,906.75, losing 1,649.50 points, or 2.82%.
Other Nifty sectors such as Auto, IT, Financial Services, Pharma, FMCG, Metal, Media, Energy, Private Bank, Infra, Commodities, and PSE also saw declines.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), 1,057 shares advanced, while 2,935 shares declined. Ninety-three shares remained unchanged.
In the Sensex pack, stocks including Tech Mahindra, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors, L&T, SBI, TCS, UltraTech Cement, Power Grid, Reliance, and Tata Steel recorded losses. On the other hand, Nestle India and Titan emerged as gainers.
Market analysts cited disappointment over the Federal Reserve’s stance on rate cuts as a key factor influencing the bearish global sentiment.
The rupee traded at 85.02 against the dollar, gaining 0.12 on the day, recovering from levels near 85.10.

Title: Tennis-Australian Open to provide platform for pickleball from 2025
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 11:14:35 +0000
Content: The Australian Open will embrace one of the fastest growing sports in the world when it hosts the inaugural AO Pickleball Slam on the final weekend of next month’s tennis major with $100,000 in prize money.
Invented in 1965 by a group of American friends, pickleball is a fast-paced paddle sport similar to tennis and badminton played on smaller courts using a perforated plastic ball, and interest has skyrocketed in recent years.
Melbourne Park’s court three will transform into pickleball central from Jan. 24-26 next year, as an international field of players compete for honours.
“Pickleball is a sport for everyone, and its rapid growth globally highlights its unique ability to connect people of all ages and backgrounds,” said Tennis Australia’s chief tennis officer Tom Larner.
“By bringing pickleball to the AO, we’re embracing the future of racket sports and providing an incredible experience for players and fans alike.”
Pickleball was also part of the Miami Open in March and was demonstrated at the French Open Grand Slam in June.
But some fans view the convergence of the two at mainstream tournaments as efforts by tennis to ensure advertising funds are not diverted away from it to pickleball.
That has not stopped pickleball from pushing ahead with its own expansion plans.
The Professional Pickleball Association based in the United States announced in July that it would hold ranking tournaments outside the country for the first time next year, with stops in Australia, India, Canada, Asia and Europe.
Its parent body the United Pickleball Association had said then that pickleball was the fastest growing sport in the U.S. with a 52% increase in participants from 2022-2023.
Major League Pickleball, a professional league where NBA great LeBron James is part of a team’s ownership group, believes the sport can reach 40 million players by 2030.
The sport has also attracted the attention of former athletes and celebrities like Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf, Tom Brady, Taylor Swift and George Clooney.

Title: PM Modi’s popularity secured BJP’s win in Maharashtra, Haryana; Rahul’s Constitutional narrative failed: Survey
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 11:14:09 +0000
Content: The BJP decisively defeated the Congress and other opposition parties in the Maharashtra and Haryana Assembly elections, securing victories in both states and forming governments there recently.
The Matrize Survey provided insights into the factors that contributed to the BJP’s significant triumph in these states, despite its relatively lower performance in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The survey highlighted several reasons, including the enduring influence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Congress-led opposition’s failure to pose an effective challenge to the BJP. It also underscored shifts in voter sentiment between the two elections. The Congress’ attempt to capitalize on the narrative of “constitutional changes” failed to make any significant impact during the Assembly elections.
The survey was conducted between November 25, 2024, and December 14, 2024, with a sample size of 76,830 respondents in Maharashtra and 53,647 in Haryana.
PM Modi’s enduring popularity played a pivotal role in the BJP’s victory. Despite the party winning only 240 seats in the Lok Sabha elections this year, he continued to enjoy massive popularity among voters in both Maharashtra and Haryana. The survey revealed that voters in these states maintained unwavering trust in him. Around 55 percent of voters surveyed in Maharashtra and 53 percent in Haryana reported a surge in PM Modi’s popularity, underscoring his strong and decisive leadership image.
The Congress’ failure to sustain its narrative on constitutional changes, spearheaded by Rahul Gandhi during the Lok Sabha elections, emerged as another significant factor. Although the claim gained some traction during the parliamentary elections, it failed to resonate during the Assembly elections. Issues like constitutional amendments, farm laws, and wrestlers’ concerns, which the Congress tried to highlight, were largely dismissed by voters in Maharashtra and Haryana.
Voter perception of Rahul Gandhi’s leadership further contributed to the Congress’ poor performance. He was perceived as disconnected from ground realities and unable to present a credible alternative to PM Modi. This perception was particularly stark in comparison to Modi’s image as a strong and influential leader.
The survey suggested a shift in voter sentiment between the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections. Many voters in Maharashtra and Haryana, who refrained from voting for the BJP in the parliamentary polls, corrected their decision in the Assembly elections. This shift was attributed to growing confidence in PM Modi’s leadership and the central government’s policies, which voters believed positively impacted their lives. The inability of the opposition to offer a coherent and convincing alternative further solidified the BJP’s appeal.
BJP’s strategic messaging during the Assembly elections significantly influenced voter preferences. The slogan “Ek Hain to Safe Hain” (When united, we are safe) struck a chord with voters, emphasizing stability, national security, and economic growth under PM Modi’s leadership. Conversely, the Congress’ internal struggles and divisive rhetoric alienated voters, highlighting its failure to counter the BJP’s narrative effectively.
In Haryana, a leadership change from Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar to a new set of leaders also contributed to BJP’s success. The survey indicated that 44 percent of respondents viewed the leadership change positively. Additionally, strong local BJP leaders and a well-organized campaign played a critical role in solidifying the party’s base.
The BJP’s focus on local issues and welfare schemes further bolstered its voter support. Initiatives in agriculture, infrastructure, and rural development were well-received, with many voters acknowledging their direct benefits from government schemes.
The Matrize Survey has provided a comprehensive understanding of the BJP’s victories in Maharashtra and Haryana. The enduring popularity of PM Modi, the Congress’ inability to maintain its narrative on constitutional changes, voter correction of past decisions, and the BJP’s focus on effective governance, strategic messaging, and welfare schemes were key factors that contributed to the party’s resounding success.

Title: Batting for Global South, India dispatches 1000 tonnes of humanitarian assistance to Lesotho

Content: India on Friday dispatched a consignment of 1000 metric tonnes of rice as part of its humanitarian assistance to Lesotho that will help in addressing food security and nutritional requirements of the people of the landlocked African country.
The consignment departed from Nhava Sheva Port, informed the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).
India has dispatched similar consignments in the past as a gesture of goodwill and friendship between the two countries and to mitigate the devastating effect of food shortages caused by famine and other acts of nature in the in sub-Saharan African nation.
Guided by South-South cooperation, India and Lesotho have been working on development partnership, trade and economic relations, energy, agriculture, health, art and culture and consular matters.
India, which has always stood by Africa in times of trouble, had also provided 150 tonnes of medical aid to 32 countries in Africa during the Covid-19 pandemic under its noble ‘Vaccine Maitri’ initiative.
The government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also provided relief material to African countries hit by natural disasters whether it is Zambia, Malawi, Kenya or Mozambique.
Earlier this year, External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar had stated that the deep-rooted India-Africa relations that go back in history, have been redefined by PM Modi’s 10 guiding principles.
These include India’s commitment to liberate Africa’s potential by building local capacity and creating local opportunities; keeping Indian markets open; sharing India’s experience with the digital revolution to support Africa’s development; improving delivery of public services; extending education and spreading digital literacy in Africa; improving Africa’s agriculture; addressing the challenges of climate change; and working with African nations to keep the oceans open and free for the benefit of all nations among others.

Title: US to announce final package of new arms for Ukraine in coming days, sources say
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 10:38:36 +0000
Content: The Biden administration will announce in the coming days its final Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative package, using up the remaining funds set aside to buy new weapons for Ukraine, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
The package includes air defense interceptors and artillery munitions, according to a third source, but the exact contents are expected when the package is announced in the coming days. The package will be worth about $1.2 billion, said the sources.
Under USAI, military equipment is procured from the defense industry or partners, rather than drawn from American stocks, meaning it can take months or years to arrive on the battlefield.
The USAI package could be among the last steps the United States takes to provide direct military support to Ukraine as Kyiv braces for the return of President-elect Donald Trump, who has publicly questioned military aid and vowed to end the Ukraine war within 24 hours of taking office on Jan. 20.
Since Russia’s invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, the United States has committed $175 billion in aid for Ukraine, including approximately $61.4 billion in security assistance.
About half of that security assistance has come through the USAI program, and the rest has gone toward pulling from existing military stocks via presidential drawdown authority.
There is $5.6 billion remaining of presidential drawdown authority.
The State Department and Pentagon declined to comment on the upcoming announcement, saying they do not discuss security assistance packages before they are officially revealed.
The USAI program has been a boon for U.S. defense contractors, who have been able to book orders for newly manufactured weapons and establish new revenue streams.
One example is the L3Harris Technologies VAMPIRE system. The Vehicle-Agnostic Modular Palletized ISR Rocket Equipment counter-drone system received its first USAI-funded order in August 2022.
L3Harris delivered its first four units within 12 months. The company has seen increased interest in the system, and has subsequently had multiple orders placed through the USAI program.
As the Biden administration prepares to unveil details of the final USAI package, questions remain about how and whether the United States will continue to assist its ally in the absence of dedicated USAI funding.
During his campaign, Trump repeatedly questioned the level of U.S. involvement in the conflict, suggesting European allies should bear more of the financial burden. Some of his fellow Republicans – who will control both the House of Representatives and Senate starting next month – have also cooled on aid to Kyiv.
This stance – despite strong past support in the U.S. Congress for sustained or expanded support for Ukraine – has raised concerns among Ukraine’s supporters in Washington about the future of U.S. assistance under a Trump administration.

Title: Indian environmentalist Madhav Gadgil receives UNEP’s Lifetime Achievement Award 2024
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 10:06:55 +0000
Content: The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has awarded prominent Indian environmentalist Madhav Gadgil the Lifetime Achievement Award, the United Nations’ highest environmental honor. With this accolade, Gadgil joins the hall of fame alongside other esteemed laureates such as David Attenborough and Joan Carling.
In total, six individuals have been named recipients of the Champions of the Earth 2024 Award: Amy Bowers Cordalis and Gabriel Paun for Inspiration and Action; Lu Qi for Science and Innovation; Sekem for Entrepreneurial Vision; and Sonia Guajajara for Policy Leadership.
The announcement was shared by the United Nations Mission in India in a post on X (formerly Twitter), stating, “Indian ecologist Madhav Gadgil is among the six @UNEP Champions of the Earth 2024, who are at the forefront of efforts to restore the #environment. Join the #EarthChamps to defend our planet. We are #GenerationRestoration.”
According to UNEP, Madhav Gadgil has authored seven books and over 200 scientific papers. His landmark work, famously known as the Gadgil Report, called for the protection of India’s ecologically sensitive Western Ghats mountain range.
Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP, praised Gadgil’s contributions in a statement: “Science can help us find solutions to the devastating loss of nature our world is experiencing. Madhav Gadgil has demonstrated this for decades. His work has advanced conservation while demonstrating a deep respect for people and community knowledge, bringing to the fore lasting solutions for some of India’s most pressing environmental challenges.”
During his career at the Indian Institute of Science, Gadgil founded the Centre for Ecological Sciences. One of his notable achievements through the centre was the establishment of India’s first biosphere reserve, the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, in 1986, UNEP noted.
UNEP also highlighted that Gadgil has been a member of several government agencies and committees, including the Prime Minister’s Scientific Advisory Council. He was one of the architects of India’s Biological Diversity Act and played a key role in the implementation of the Forest Rights Act. These laws have empowered forest communities to establish registers to monitor biodiversity in local ecosystems.
Over the years, Gadgil’s wide-ranging contributions have earned him some of India’s highest civilian honors, including the Padma Shri and Padma Bhushan, as well as international recognition such as the Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement and the Volvo Environment Prize, UNEP stated.

Title: Centre, ADB sign $350 million loan to boost India’s supply chains
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 16:26:25 +0000
Content: The Indian government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have signed a $350 million policy-based loan agreement to support the Strengthening Multimodal and Integrated Logistics Ecosystem (SMILE) programme.
This loan, under the programme’s second subprogramme, is aimed at improving the logistics framework to enhance manufacturing capabilities and build resilient supply chains in the country.
The Ministry of Commerce and Industry noted that the SMILE programme supports wide-ranging reforms in India’s logistics sector through a programmatic policy-based loan structure. It comprises two subprogrammes designed to promote the manufacturing sector and bolster supply chain systems.
The loan agreement was formalised with the involvement of the Department of Economic Affairs under the Ministry of Finance, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, and the ADB. The SMILE programme establishes a policy framework to improve logistics efficiency. It focuses on developing multimodal logistics infrastructure across national, state, and city levels, while standardising warehousing and logistics assets.
The initiative also seeks to engage the private sector in enhancing external trade logistics, improving operational efficiencies, and adopting low-emission smart systems. 
The ministry emphasised that reforms in the logistics sector are aligned with efforts to enhance the manufacturing sector’s global competitiveness. Steps such as policy advancements, infrastructure upgrades, and technological integration aim to lower costs, improve trade efficiencies, and create job opportunities while advancing inclusive growth.
In a separate development, the Indian government and ADB have agreed on a $42 million loan to support coastal and riverbank protection initiatives in Maharashtra. This funding will help stabilise the state’s coastline, protect the livelihoods of local communities, and safeguard natural ecosystems.

Title: Cabinet hikes MSP for Copra to Rs 12,100 per quintal
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 16:03:45 +0000
Content: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Friday hiked the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for fair average quality of milling copra to Rs 11,582 per quintal and for ball copra to Rs 12,100 per quintal for the 2025 marketing season, according to an official statement.
The MSP has been increased in accordance with the government’s decision that mandates the MSP for crops will be fixed at levels of at least 1.5 times the all-India weighted average cost of production, the statement said.
“The Government has increased MSP for milling copra and ball copra from Rs 5,250 per quintal and Rs 5,500 per quintal for the marketing season 2014 to Rs 11,582 per quintal and Rs 12,100 per quintal for the marketing season 2025, registering a growth of 121 per cent and 120 per cent, respectively,” the statement said.
A higher MSP will not only ensure better remunerative returns to the coconut growers but also incentivise farmers to expand copra production to meet the growing demand for coconut products both domestically and internationally, it added.
The National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) and the National Cooperative Consumers’ Federation (NCCF) will continue to act as Central Nodal Agencies (CNAs) for procurement of copra and de-husked coconut under the Price Support Scheme (PSS), the statement added.
The main objective of the Centre’s procurement is to assure farmers get remunerative prices and distribution to consumers, particularly the vulnerable sections of society takes place at affordable prices.
The Centre maintains a buffer stock for food security and price stability. Similarly, the Central government extends price support to paddy, coarse grains and wheat through the FCI and state agencies.
All the food grains (wheat and paddy) conforming to the prescribed specifications offered for sale at specified centres are bought by the public procurement agencies at the Minimum Support Price (MSP), inclusive of the bonus announced, if any. The farmers have the option to sell their produce to the FCI/state agencies at MSP or in the open market as is advantageous to them.

Title: States urge centre for greater financial support during pre-budget discussions
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 15:50:41 +0000
Content: Several states raised financial concerns and demands during the pre-budget meeting chaired by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in Jaisalmer on Friday. The meeting, part of the formal consultations ahead of the Union Budget 2025-26, witnessed participation from state representatives, finance officials, and key stakeholders.
Sources indicate that some states urged the Centre to cover a larger portion of land acquisition costs for infrastructure and development projects. Requests were also made for increased allocation under the 50-year interest-free loan scheme introduced to assist states in undertaking various capital projects.
States also sought a relaxation in borrowing limits to aid fiscal operations. Certain representatives requested higher honoraria for Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA) workers, who play a pivotal role in the health sector. Punjab and Kerala sought specific financial packages, encompassing additional loans, grants, and borrowing flexibility.
Several states emphasized the necessity for augmented disaster relief funding and sought greater allocations under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF). Enhanced funds for the Jal Jeevan Mission were also requested, particularly for water storage and tank development to improve water supply infrastructure.
The consultation was attended by Chief Ministers from states including Goa, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Meghalaya, and Odisha; Deputy Chief Ministers from Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Telangana; and Finance Ministers and senior officials of various states and union territories. Senior finance ministry officials, including secretaries from the Departments of Economic Affairs and Expenditure, were also present.
This meeting coincided with the gathering of state ministers for the GST Council meeting scheduled for Saturday in Jaisalmer. Pre-budget meetings are a routine exercise by the Finance Ministry to engage with diverse stakeholders, including MSMEs, farmer associations, and economists, to gain insights ahead of the budget formulation process.
The Union Budget 2025-26 is slated for presentation on February 1, 2025. It will outline the government’s financial plans and economic policy direction for the coming fiscal year.

Title: India raises security concerns over threats to ambassador Kwatra
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 15:35:57 +0000
Content: The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has raised concerns with the United States regarding threats issued against Indian Ambassador to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra. The threats were reportedly made by US-based Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.
MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, speaking at the weekly press briefing in New Delhi, stated that India addresses such matters with urgency. “Whenever such threats are issued, we bring them to the notice of the US government,” Jaiswal said. He expressed India’s expectation that its security concerns would be duly addressed.
Pannun, designated as a terrorist by India, is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada. This issue follows an earlier MEA confirmation regarding a US Justice Department indictment involving a failed plot to assassinate Pannun.
In October, the MEA confirmed that an individual named in the US Justice Department’s indictment in the case was no longer employed by the Indian government. “The US State Department informed us that the person in the indictment is no longer associated with the Government of India,” Jaiswal said during a prior briefing.
The US Justice Department’s indictment alleged that an Indian government employee had recruited Nikhil Gupta, an Indian national, to hire a hitman to assassinate Pannun. US authorities claim to have foiled the plot.

Title: PM Modi’s visit to Kuwait very significant, will take bilateral ties to new heights: Indian envoy Swaika
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 11:57:43 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s upcoming visit to Kuwait, scheduled for December 21-22, is set to significantly enhance bilateral relations between India and Kuwait, according to India’s Ambassador to Kuwait, Adarsh Swaika.
This visit, which marks a milestone after a gap of 43 years, is especially significant as it is the only country in the Gulf region that PM Modi has not visited so far. Additionally, it represents the first high-level visit between the two nations in the past decade, with the last visit by a Kuwaiti prime minister to India occurring in 2013.
In a statement to ANI, Ambassador Swaika highlighted the importance of the visit. “This visit is very significant, particularly in the context of three important facts. First, it is taking place after 43 years, second, it is the only Gulf country Prime Minister Modi had not visited yet, and third, it marks the first high-level visit in over a decade,” he said.
During his visit, PM Modi is expected to meet Kuwait’s leadership and engage with the large Indian expatriate community in Kuwait. The visit is seen as having strong symbolic value, with Ambassador Swaika noting that the outcomes will be “concrete” and will take India-Kuwait relations to new heights.
The Indian expatriate community in Kuwait plays a key role in strengthening the relationship between the two nations. India is the largest source of expatriates in Kuwait, and the community contributes significantly to the Kuwaiti economy through remittances. In fact, last year, Indian expatriates sent back $6.3 billion in remittances.
Swaika further emphasized the strong economic ties between India and Kuwait. “India is one of Kuwait’s top trading partners. Kuwait is the sixth-largest source of India’s crude oil imports, and India also supplies essential food products to Kuwait to help meet its food security needs,” he said. Bilateral trade has also seen substantial growth, reaching $2 billion for the first time last year, with many “Make in India” products being exported.
Additionally, investments from Kuwaiti companies, including the sovereign wealth fund Kuwait Investment Authority, are growing in India. On the other hand, Indian companies are actively involved in executing large-scale infrastructure projects in Kuwait, in line with Kuwait’s Vision 2035, a long-term development plan aimed at diversifying its economy.
Ambassador Swaika also said the increasing frequency of high-level diplomatic exchanges between the two nations in recent months. External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar visited Kuwait in August, while Kuwait’s Foreign Minister visited India in December. Moreover, PM Modi met Kuwait’s Crown Prince in New York in September, further cementing the strong diplomatic ties.
In a press release, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) stated, “India and Kuwait have long enjoyed close and friendly relations, built on a shared history and strengthened by robust economic ties and strong people-to-people connections. India is one of Kuwait’s key trading partners, and the Indian community represents the largest expatriate group in the country. This visit offers a valuable opportunity to further enhance the diverse and dynamic relationship between the two nations.”

Title: Novo Nordisk shares plunge after CagriSema obesity drug trial disappoints
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 11:52:01 +0000
Content: Novo Nordisk said on Friday its experimental next-generation obesity drug CagriSema helped patients cut their weight by 22.7% in a late-stage trial, below the 25% it had expected, wiping as much as $125 billion off its market value.
The lower-than-expected weight loss from the drug candidate deals a blow to the Danish company’s ambitions for a successor to its popular Wegovy that is more powerful than Eli Lilly’s rival Zepbound, also known as Mounjaro.
Investors and analysts had eagerly awaited this data as a test of Novo’s case that it has a strong pipeline of drugs to follow Wegovy in the fiercely competitive anti-obesity market.
Novo’s share price fell as much as 27% after the results were announced on Friday, to their lowest since August 2023.
Shares in U.S. rival Lilly rose more than 7% in pre-market trade.
Novo said if all people adhered to treatment with CagriSema, patients overall achieved weight loss of 22.7% after 68 weeks, with 40.4% losing 25% or more.
The data from the Phase III trial was based on about 3,400 people with a body mass index (BMI) of or above 30, or people with a BMI of 27 and at least one weight-related comorbidity like hypertension or cardiovascular disease.
Martin Holst Lange, executive vice president for development, said Novo was “encouraged” by the data.
He said only 57% of patients in the trial reached the highest dose, adding: “With the insights obtained from the REDEFINE 1 trial, we plan to further explore the additional weight loss potential of CagriSema.”
Novo said the drug had similar side effects compared to its GLP-1 drugs already on the market. The most common adverse events with CagriSema were gastrointestinal, and the vast majority were mild to moderate and diminished over time, consistent with the GLP-1 receptor agonist class, it said.
WEEKLY INJECTION
CagriSema is a weekly injection which combines semaglutide, which is the active ingredient in Wegovy and mimics the gut hormone GLP-1, and a separate molecule called cagrilintide that mimics the pancreatic hormone amylin, into a weekly injection.
The two hormones combined suppress hunger and help control patients’ blood glucose.
Novo’s trial is the most advanced for an amylin drug candidate currently being tested in the market.
The success of Wegovy helped make Novo Europe’s biggest company by market capitalisation, worth more than $460 billion. Its shares have been under pressure this year, however, significantly underperforming those of chief rival Lilly, due mainly to concerns Novo may be losing its first-mover advantage in the obesity drug race.
Lilly’s own obesity injection – sold as Zepbound in the United States and Mounjaro in other markets where it has launched – led to an average weight loss of nearly 23% in clinical trials.

Title: Indian stock markets decline over 1.4% amid global selloff
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 11:27:19 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market faced a sharp decline on Friday, shedding over 1,000 points, following indications from the US Federal Reserve of a cautious approach to interest rate cuts.
Major selling was observed in Nifty’s realty and PSU bank sectors. By the end of trading, the Sensex settled at 78,041.59, down 1,176.46 points, or 1.49%, while the Nifty closed at 23,587.50, declining 364.20 points, or 1.52%.
Krishna Appala from Capitalmind Research attributed the market’s current state to stock-specific trends, noting that broader indices appear to be pausing. He pointed to several influential factors, including the forthcoming US Presidential transition in January and the Union Budget announcement in India.
The Nifty Bank index ended at 50,759.20, a drop of 816.50 points, or 1.58%. The Nifty Midcap 100 index closed at 56,906.75, losing 1,649.50 points, or 2.82%.
Other Nifty sectors such as Auto, IT, Financial Services, Pharma, FMCG, Metal, Media, Energy, Private Bank, Infra, Commodities, and PSE also saw declines.
On the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), 1,057 shares advanced, while 2,935 shares declined. Ninety-three shares remained unchanged.
In the Sensex pack, stocks including Tech Mahindra, IndusInd Bank, Axis Bank, Mahindra & Mahindra, Tata Motors, L&T, SBI, TCS, UltraTech Cement, Power Grid, Reliance, and Tata Steel recorded losses. On the other hand, Nestle India and Titan emerged as gainers.
Market analysts cited disappointment over the Federal Reserve’s stance on rate cuts as a key factor influencing the bearish global sentiment.
The rupee traded at 85.02 against the dollar, gaining 0.12 on the day, recovering from levels near 85.10.

Title: Tennis-Australian Open to provide platform for pickleball from 2025
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 11:14:35 +0000
Content: The Australian Open will embrace one of the fastest growing sports in the world when it hosts the inaugural AO Pickleball Slam on the final weekend of next month’s tennis major with $100,000 in prize money.
Invented in 1965 by a group of American friends, pickleball is a fast-paced paddle sport similar to tennis and badminton played on smaller courts using a perforated plastic ball, and interest has skyrocketed in recent years.
Melbourne Park’s court three will transform into pickleball central from Jan. 24-26 next year, as an international field of players compete for honours.
“Pickleball is a sport for everyone, and its rapid growth globally highlights its unique ability to connect people of all ages and backgrounds,” said Tennis Australia’s chief tennis officer Tom Larner.
“By bringing pickleball to the AO, we’re embracing the future of racket sports and providing an incredible experience for players and fans alike.”
Pickleball was also part of the Miami Open in March and was demonstrated at the French Open Grand Slam in June.
But some fans view the convergence of the two at mainstream tournaments as efforts by tennis to ensure advertising funds are not diverted away from it to pickleball.
That has not stopped pickleball from pushing ahead with its own expansion plans.
The Professional Pickleball Association based in the United States announced in July that it would hold ranking tournaments outside the country for the first time next year, with stops in Australia, India, Canada, Asia and Europe.
Its parent body the United Pickleball Association had said then that pickleball was the fastest growing sport in the U.S. with a 52% increase in participants from 2022-2023.
Major League Pickleball, a professional league where NBA great LeBron James is part of a team’s ownership group, believes the sport can reach 40 million players by 2030.
The sport has also attracted the attention of former athletes and celebrities like Andre Agassi, Steffi Graf, Tom Brady, Taylor Swift and George Clooney.

Title: Sri Sri Ravi Shankar brings peace through meditation to UN headquarters consumed by global turmoil
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 06:57:39 +0000
Content: Eighteen minutes of tranquility descended on the world organisation’s headquarters consumed by global turmoil as Sri Sri Ravi Shankar led a meditation session as a path to peace at the United Nations.
At that very moment on Friday, the Security Council down the corridor was grappling with “threats to international peace and security” in a bitter debate, having earlier in the day disposed of topics like “children in armed conflicts”, the tensions in the Middle East and Africa, and the Ukraine War.
In the oasis of peace at the Trusteeship Council Chamber, Ravi Shankar presided over the ‘Meditation for Global Peace and Harmony’ on the eve of World Meditation Day newly minted by the General Assembly this month.
He noted that there are a lot of discussions about peace and security at the UN, and meditation can bring inner security and inner peace to make the world a much better place.
“I urge all the nations here to put a little more attention in peace education. Let us educate our young people, how to relax, how to get rid of tensions on a daily basis, how to manage their negative emotions, and be centered”, said Ravi Shankar, who founded the Art of Living Foundation.
The General Assembly adopted by acclamation on December 6 the resolution moved by a core group of India, Liechtenstein, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Mexico, and Andorra, and joined by many others to declare the Winter Solstice Day the World Meditation Day.
It bookends with the International Day of Yoga on Summer Solstice Day, which was also declared by the General Assembly at India’s initiative.
General Assembly President Philemon Yang said, “Meditation transcends borders, faiths, traditions, and time, offering each of us the opportunity to pause, to listen, and to connect with our inner selves.”
“In its silence, meditation speaks a universal truth: That we are all human, all seeking balance, and all striving for a better understanding of our inner self and the world in which we live”, he said.
Under-Secretary-General Atul Khare said that the UN peacekeepers are “tasked with protecting civilians against physical violence, and are often themselves exposed to atrocities, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is critical that their mental health is taken care of and for this the UN introduced an app in 16 languages that includes meditation to help them.”
India’s Permanent Representative P. Harish said, “The ancient Indian practice of ‘Dhyana’, or meditation, goes back thousands of years to yogic traditions and holds the key to achieve inner calm and attain harmony between mind and body, thought and action, humanity and the external world.”
The winter solstice in the Indian tradition, “is the beginning of ‘uttarayana’, an auspicious time of the year, especially for inner reflection”, he said.
“India’s leadership in overall human well-being stems from our civilisational dictum of Vasudaiva Kutumbakam or the whole world is one family”, he added.

Title: What is US birthright citizenship and can Trump end it?
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 05:36:27 +0000
Content: Donald Trump has said he plans to end birthright citizenship as part of his promised crackdown on immigration when he becomes president on Jan. 20.
Below is a look at U.S. birthright citizenship and Trump’s legal authority to restrict it.
WHAT IS BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP?
Anyone born in the United States is considered a citizen at birth, which derives from the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment, which was added to the Constitution in 1868. The amendment states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 also defines citizens and includes similar language.
There were an estimated 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally in January 2022, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimate, a figure that some analysts now place at 13 million to 14 million. Their U.S.-born children are considered by the government to have U.S. citizenship. Trump has complained about foreign women visiting the United States for the purpose of giving birth and conferring U.S. citizenship on their offspring.
ARE THERE EXCEPTIONS?
Yes. People born in the United States to a foreign diplomatic officer with diplomatic immunity are not U.S. citizens because they are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.
WHAT HAS THE SUPREME COURT SAID?
The Supreme Court has not addressed whether the Citizenship Clause applies to U.S.-born children of people who are in the United States illegally.
The main birthright citizenship case is from 1898, when the Supreme Court ruled that the son of lawful immigrants from China was a U.S. citizen by virtue of his birth in 1873 in San Francisco. The man, Wong Kim Ark, had been denied re-entry to the United States after a visit to China at a time when immigration from China was severely restricted.
The Supreme Court also ruled in 1884 in a dispute over voter registration that U.S.-born John Elk was not a citizen because he was born as a member of a Native American tribe and therefore not subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Congress extended U.S. citizenship to Native Americans in 1924.
WHAT IS THE VIEW OF OPPONENTS OF BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP?
Some scholars argue that if lawmakers wanted all people born in the country to be citizens, they would not have added the clause to the 14th Amendment specifying that citizens “be subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States.
They argue that this language excludes people who entered the country illegally and by implications, their U.S.-born children. Republican senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Tom Cotton from Arkansas proposed bills this year that defined U.S.-born children as not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the U.S. if their parents were in the country illegally.
Most scholars are dismissive of that interpretation of the jurisdiction language. Unlike diplomats, people in the country illegally do not have legal immunity and are subject to the U.S. laws.
CAN TRUMP END BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP WITH AN EXECUTIVE ORDER?
The Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate citizenship, and no president has ever tried to redefine the rules of citizenship using executive orders, though Trump promised to do so in his first term.
Trump could issue an executive order to redefine birthright citizenship. Legal experts said he might declare that it requires one parent must be a U.S. citizen, a permanent resident or a member of the military — language that appeared in the Graham bill. He could direct his agencies to withhold passports or other documents and benefits unless the person meets the new requirement.
Anyone denied a document or benefit could challenge it and legal experts said the executive order would almost certainly be blocked immediately in the courts. But it would also put the issue on a path toward the Supreme Court and likely force the justices to determine who is entitled to birthright citizenship.
If courts decided the Constitution protected birthright citizenship, then only an amendment could change that. A Constitutional amendment would require two-thirds of both houses and approval by three-quarters of state legislatures, a process that would likely take years. The Constitution has not been amended since 1992.

Title: Bears colour stock market red ahead of Christmas, time for balanced investment strategy
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 05:17:32 +0000
Content: Indian benchmark indices declined 5 per cent this week amid global selloff, mainly triggered by the US Federal Reserve’s caution approach for rate cuts next year, which resulted in relentless selling by the foreign institutional investors (FIIs).
With this, Sensex lost over 1,000 points in three out of five trading sessions this week, and nearly Rs 17 lakh crore worth of market cap was eroded out of BSE-listed firms.
According to market experts, it had been a dreadful week for the equity markets, as the key indices fell dramatically, erasing the gains of the last four weeks.
“The benchmark index experienced a significant decline, plummeting approximately 1,200 points from the previous week’s closing figure. As a result, it finished the week below 200 simple moving average (SMA), marking a total loss of nearly 5 per cent,” said Osho Krishnan from Angel One.
The Nifty50 experienced a significant decline, as it breached all essential support levels. This downward movement has led the index to approach its most recent swing low, signalling potential volatility in the market.
From a technical standpoint, as Nifty slipped below the pivotal zone of 200 SMA, the next potential support could be seen around the recent swing low around 23,200-23,100, while a decisive breach is likely to open further downside towards 22,800 in the near period, said Krishnan.
The weak global cues initiated the downward move, but the follow-up sell-off showcases the bears’ eagerness to colour the market red ahead of Christmas.
On Friday, Sensex settled at 78,041.59, down by 1,176.46 points or 1.49 per cent, and Nifty ended at 23,587.50, down by 364.20 points, or 1.52 per cent.
Nifty Bank ended at 50,759.20, down by 816.50 points, or 1.58 per cent. The Nifty Midcap 100 index closed at 56,906.75 at the end of trading after dropping 1,649.50 points, or 2.82 per cent.
On the sectoral front, selling was seen in Nifty’s Auto, IT, Fin Services, Pharma, FMCG, Metal, Media, Energy, Private Bank, Infra, Commodities, and PSE sectors.
Considering the recent developments, it is advised to approach markets with proper risk management and refrain from taking complacent bets for the time being, advised experts.
Amid this cautious environment, “we maintain a bullish outlook on new-age, platform-based technology companies,” said Krishna Appala from Capitalmind Research.
A balanced investment strategy that combines the stability and fair valuations of large caps with tactical exposure to profitable, domestic-focused tech companies offers a prudent approach to capturing growth potential while managing geopolitical and policy risks, said experts.

Title: Solidifying partnership with Gulf countries, PM Modi set to embark on historic Kuwait visit
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 04:13:42 +0000
Content: Committed to fostering longstanding, historic and close relations with all Gulf countries, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will undertake a two-day visit to Kuwait starting Saturday – the first by an Indian PM to the key West Asian country in 43 years.
“India and Kuwait share traditionally close and friendly relations which are rooted in history and have been underpinned by economic and strong people to people linkages. India is among the top trading partners of Kuwait. The Indian community is the largest expatriate community in Kuwait. The visit will provide an opportunity to further strengthen the multifaceted ties between India and Kuwait,” the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said ahead of PM Modi’s historic visit.
During the visit, the Prime Minister will hold discussions with the leadership of Kuwait – including Sheikh Meshal Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the Emir of the State of Kuwait – and is also scheduled to interact with the large Indian community in the country.
PM Modi will be accorded a Ceremonial Guard of Honour at the Bayan Palace, following which he will hold separate one-on-one meetings with the Emir and the Crown Prince of Kuwait. It will be followed by delegation-level talks with the Prime Minister of Kuwait during which both sides will review the entire spectrum of bilateral relations, including areas such as politics, trade, investment, energy, culture, people-to-people ties, and the steps needed to further enhance them.
“India and Kuwait share an age-old bond characterized by historical ties, robust economic exchanges, and vibrant cultural connections,” MEA Secretary (CPV &amp; OIA) Arun Kumar Chatterjee told reporters on Friday.
Ahead of the landmark visit, the MEA spotlighted that there has been a major transformation in India’s ties with the Gulf region and the PM has given “special emphasis” to strengthen and deepen relations with the Gulf countries.
Kuwait currently holds the current presidency of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – also comprising the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman and Qatar – and the only GCC member country that PM Modi has not visited so far since assuming office in 2014. A proposed visit in 2022 was postponed due to the Covid pandemic.
Gulf countries are major trade and investment partners for India, and New Delhi also has a strong energy partnership with these countries.
During the visit, PM Modi will also interact with the Indian diaspora at a community event and will also visit a labour camp. He will also attend the opening ceremony of the 26th Arabian Gulf Cup as a special guest of the Emir of Kuwait.
“The government of India attaches considerable importance to the welfare of all workers abroad. We have a community of around one million Indians in the country. The purpose of the Prime Minister’s visit to the labour camps is to emphasise the importance the government of India places on the welfare of our workers in foreign countries,” stated Chatterjee.
Earlier this month, as he called on PM Modi at his Lok Kalyan Marg residence during his visit to New Delhi, Kuwait’s Foreign Minister Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya had extended an invitation to the Prime Minister from the Kuwait leadership to visit the country “at the earliest opportunity which the PM had graciously accepted.
A few hours later, as he held the delegation-level talks with External Affairs Minister (EAM) S. Jaishankar at the Hyderabad House, Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya called India as a “very important partner” and Prime Minister Modi as “one of the wisest persons” in the world.
“I would like to thank you for the invitation and also for the opportunity of meeting Prime Minister Modi, who we believe is one of the wisest persons worldwide. I am sure that the Prime Minister puts India on a better level, and I am sure that he will continue that… India is a very important partner and we count on our relationship,” the visiting Foreign Minister said in the meeting held on December 4.
In September, PM Modi had met with Sheikh Sabah Khaled Al-Hamad Al-Mubarak Al-Sabah, Crown Prince of the State of Kuwait, on the sidelines of the 79th session of the UNGA in New York in what was the first meeting between the two leaders.
Recalling the strong historical ties and people-to-people linkages between the two countries during the meeting, Prime Minister Modi had conveyed that India attaches “utmost importance” to its bilateral relations with Kuwait.
The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) later said that the meeting between the leadership of the two countries is expected to impart a “fresh momentum” to bilateral ties between India and Kuwait.
“They noted with satisfaction that the two countries were supporting each other with energy and food security requirements. They expressed their firm commitment to deepen and diversify bilateral ties for the mutual benefit of both countries. Prime Minister thanked the Crown Prince for ensuring the well-being of the Indian community in Kuwait, which is the largest diaspora group in the country,” read a statement issued by the MEA on September 22, 2024.
During his discussions with the visiting Kuwait Foreign Minister earlier this month, PM Modi had once again expressed confidence that the close cooperation between India and the Gulf Cooperation Council would be further strengthened under Kuwait’s ongoing Presidency of the GCC.
As they exchanged views on the situation in West Asia and expressed support for early return of peace, security and stability in the region, PM Modi thanked the leadership of Kuwait for taking care of the one million strong Indian community living in Kuwait.
Later, EAM Jaishankar and Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya had reaffirmed their joint commitment to enhancing stability and security in the region and the world.
“Following the meeting, a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed on the establishment of a joint committee for bilateral cooperation between the State of Kuwait and the Republic of India, which reflects the determination of the two friendly countries to push the level of bilateral relations to higher, broader and more comprehensive levels,” stated Kuwait’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Title: Centre, ADB sign $350 million loan to boost India’s supply chains
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 16:26:25 +0000
Content: The Indian government and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have signed a $350 million policy-based loan agreement to support the Strengthening Multimodal and Integrated Logistics Ecosystem (SMILE) programme.
This loan, under the programme’s second subprogramme, is aimed at improving the logistics framework to enhance manufacturing capabilities and build resilient supply chains in the country.
The Ministry of Commerce and Industry noted that the SMILE programme supports wide-ranging reforms in India’s logistics sector through a programmatic policy-based loan structure. It comprises two subprogrammes designed to promote the manufacturing sector and bolster supply chain systems.
The loan agreement was formalised with the involvement of the Department of Economic Affairs under the Ministry of Finance, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, and the ADB. The SMILE programme establishes a policy framework to improve logistics efficiency. It focuses on developing multimodal logistics infrastructure across national, state, and city levels, while standardising warehousing and logistics assets.
The initiative also seeks to engage the private sector in enhancing external trade logistics, improving operational efficiencies, and adopting low-emission smart systems. 
The ministry emphasised that reforms in the logistics sector are aligned with efforts to enhance the manufacturing sector’s global competitiveness. Steps such as policy advancements, infrastructure upgrades, and technological integration aim to lower costs, improve trade efficiencies, and create job opportunities while advancing inclusive growth.
In a separate development, the Indian government and ADB have agreed on a $42 million loan to support coastal and riverbank protection initiatives in Maharashtra. This funding will help stabilise the state’s coastline, protect the livelihoods of local communities, and safeguard natural ecosystems.

Title: Cabinet hikes MSP for Copra to Rs 12,100 per quintal
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 16:03:45 +0000
Content: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on Friday hiked the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for fair average quality of milling copra to Rs 11,582 per quintal and for ball copra to Rs 12,100 per quintal for the 2025 marketing season, according to an official statement.
The MSP has been increased in accordance with the government’s decision that mandates the MSP for crops will be fixed at levels of at least 1.5 times the all-India weighted average cost of production, the statement said.
“The Government has increased MSP for milling copra and ball copra from Rs 5,250 per quintal and Rs 5,500 per quintal for the marketing season 2014 to Rs 11,582 per quintal and Rs 12,100 per quintal for the marketing season 2025, registering a growth of 121 per cent and 120 per cent, respectively,” the statement said.
A higher MSP will not only ensure better remunerative returns to the coconut growers but also incentivise farmers to expand copra production to meet the growing demand for coconut products both domestically and internationally, it added.
The National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) and the National Cooperative Consumers’ Federation (NCCF) will continue to act as Central Nodal Agencies (CNAs) for procurement of copra and de-husked coconut under the Price Support Scheme (PSS), the statement added.
The main objective of the Centre’s procurement is to assure farmers get remunerative prices and distribution to consumers, particularly the vulnerable sections of society takes place at affordable prices.
The Centre maintains a buffer stock for food security and price stability. Similarly, the Central government extends price support to paddy, coarse grains and wheat through the FCI and state agencies.
All the food grains (wheat and paddy) conforming to the prescribed specifications offered for sale at specified centres are bought by the public procurement agencies at the Minimum Support Price (MSP), inclusive of the bonus announced, if any. The farmers have the option to sell their produce to the FCI/state agencies at MSP or in the open market as is advantageous to them.

Title: India raises security concerns over threats to ambassador Kwatra
Publication Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2024 15:35:57 +0000
Content: The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has raised concerns with the United States regarding threats issued against Indian Ambassador to the US, Vinay Mohan Kwatra. The threats were reportedly made by US-based Khalistani terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.
MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal, speaking at the weekly press briefing in New Delhi, stated that India addresses such matters with urgency. “Whenever such threats are issued, we bring them to the notice of the US government,” Jaiswal said. He expressed India’s expectation that its security concerns would be duly addressed.
Pannun, designated as a terrorist by India, is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada. This issue follows an earlier MEA confirmation regarding a US Justice Department indictment involving a failed plot to assassinate Pannun.
In October, the MEA confirmed that an individual named in the US Justice Department’s indictment in the case was no longer employed by the Indian government. “The US State Department informed us that the person in the indictment is no longer associated with the Government of India,” Jaiswal said during a prior briefing.
The US Justice Department’s indictment alleged that an Indian government employee had recruited Nikhil Gupta, an Indian national, to hire a hitman to assassinate Pannun. US authorities claim to have foiled the plot.

Title: Indian diaspora, 101-year-old former IFS officer greet PM Modi on arrival in Kuwait Kuwait City
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 12:28:55 +0000
Content: The Indian community gave a rousing reception to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he arrived at his hotel in Kuwait City on Saturday afternoon, shortly after he touched down in the Gulf nation, kicking off his historic two-day visit, the first by an Indian PM to the country in 43 years.
Among those who met Prime Minister Modi warmly was 101-year-old Mangal Sain Handa, a former Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officer, who now resides in Kuwait and had served in Kuwait, United Kingdom, Iraq, China, Argentina, and Cambodia before retiring about four decades ago.
PM Modi not only exchanged greetings with Handa but also posed for photos with his family.
On Friday, Handa’s granddaughter, Shreya Juneja had posted a message for PM Modi, requesting him to meet her grandfather during his visit to Kuwait.
On Saturday, just before he boarded Air India One, Prime Minister Modi, who enjoys a massive following not just in the country but also all over the world and loves to give a personal touch to his engagement with the Indian diaspora during foreign visits, responded to Juneja’s social media post.
“Absolutely! I look forward to meeting Mangal Sain Handa Ji in Kuwait today,” wrote PM Modi.
The Prime Minister also received copies of Ramayana and Mahabharata translated in Arabic language by Abdullah Baron and published by Abdullateef Alnesef.
The Indian community, the largest expatriate group in Kuwait, continues to play a pivotal role in strengthening bilateral relations.
In his departure statement on Saturday, PM Modi had mentioned that his visit would be an opportunity to chalk out a roadmap for a futuristic partnership for the benefit of people and the region.
“I eagerly look forward to meeting the Indian diaspora in Kuwait who have immensely contributed to the strengthening of bonds of friendship between the two nations,” said Prime Minister Modi.
The Prime Minister is also scheduled to interact with the Indian diaspora at a community event besides visiting a labour camp during his two-day visit to the West Asian nation.

Title: Ukraine collects vast war data trove to train AI models
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 12:28:00 +0000
Content: As the future of warfare pivots towards artificial intelligence, Ukraine is sitting on a valuable resource: millions of hours of footage from drones which can be used to train AI models to make decisions on the battlefield.
AI has been deployed by both sides on the battlefield during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to identify targets, scanning images far quicker than a human can.
Oleksandr Dmitriev, founder of OCHI, a non-profit Ukrainian digital system which centralises and analyses video feeds from over 15,000 drone crews working on the frontlines, told Reuters his system had collected 2 million hours, or 228 years, of battlefield video from drones since 2022.
That will provide vital data for AI to learn from.
“This is food for the AI: If you want to teach an AI, you give it 2 million hours (of video), it will become something supernatural.”
According to Dmitriev, the footage can be used to train AI models in combat tactics, spotting targets and assessing the effectiveness of weapons systems.
“It is essentially experience which can be turned into mathematics,” he said, adding that an AI program can study the trajectories and angles at which weapons are most effective.
The system was originally made in 2022 to give military commanders an overview of their areas of the battlefield by showing them drone footage from all nearby crews side by side on one screen.
After the system was rolled out, the team running it realised that video being sent back by drones could prove useful as a record of the war – so they began to store it.
On average, Dmitriev said five or six terabytes of new data were added every day from the fighting.
IMAGE QUALITY
Dmitriev said he was talking with representatives from some of Ukraine’s foreign allies that had expressed interest in his OCHI system, but declined to provide details.
Samuel Bendett, adjunct senior fellow at the U.S.-based Center for a New American Security, said such a vast pool of data would be extremely valuable in teaching AI systems to identify what exactly they are seeing, and what steps they should take.
“Humans can do this intuitively, but machines cannot, and they have to be trained on what is or isn’t a road, or a natural obstacle, or an ambush,” he said.
Kateryna Bondar, a fellow at Wadhwani AI centre at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the size of the data set and the image quality were important, as AI models learned to recognise targets based on shapes and colours.
Bondar said that the dataset was valuable in the context of training to fight Russia. However, she said U.S. officials and drone makers prefer a dataset that trains AI systems to operate in the Pacific against a potential Chinese adversary.
“(They want) systems ready and able to fight against China because that’s the main priority for the U.S. right now, rather than getting a lot of footage of Ukrainian fields and forests.”
Ukraine also has another system, called Avengers, developed by its defence ministry, which centralises and collects video from drones and CCTV.
The ministry declined to provide information about this system. However, it has previously said that Avengers spots 12,000 Russian pieces of equipment a week using AI identification tools.
Thousands of drones are already using AI systems to fly themselves into targets without human piloting, and Ukraine is using AI technologies to help demine its territory.
Ukrainian companies are developing drone swarms, where a computer system will be able to execute commands for an interlinked cloud of dozens of drones.
Russia has also touted its use of battlefield AI, most notably for target recognition in Lancet strike drones, which have proved lethal against Ukrainian armoured vehicles.

Title: Shooting sport: India to host ISSF Junior World Cup for the first time in 2025
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 12:24:51 +0000
Content: India will be hosting the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) Junior World Cup for the first time in the second half of 2025. The ISSF awarded the hosting rights for the top junior international shooting competition for Rifle/Pistol/Shotgun to the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI), making it another achievement for the country in shooting sport
This will be the third top ISSF-level event to be held in India after the senior World Cup in Bhopal in 2023 and the season-ending ISSF World Cup Final earlier this year, reinforcing India’s stature as one of the sport’s top destinations in the world, the NRAI informed in a release on Saturday.
Reacting to the development after the NRAI received the official confirmation letter from the ISSF on Friday, NRAI President Kalikesh Narayan Singh Deo said, “We had a very fruitful executive committee meeting of the ISSF in Rome last month and all member federations as well as the ISSF President Luciano Rossi were all praise with the way India has been hosting top international Shooting competitions and helping to grow the sport globally.
“We obviously got the sense then but now that the official confirmation has come, we are excited and energised to put our best foot forward as usual. We are of course indebted to the Government of India and the Ministry of Sports for supporting in every possible way, our efforts to grow the sport in the country,” he said.
K. Sultan Singh, Secretary General, NRAI, elaborated on the details of the ISSF communique saying, “The ISSF in their letter have requested us to confirm two possible convenient slots, one in September-October and the other during the end October-beginning November period. We will, after meeting internally, share the same with them at the earliest so that member federations can prepare accordingly. The world’s top future champions and stars of Shooting are going to converge in India for a blockbuster showdown and we are confident that it will give the sport another grassroots boost in the country.”
This will be the ninth top-level shooting championship to be held in India over the past decade, and it will be the first ISSF Junior World Cup. Before this India had hosted continental championships and six ISSF competitions, including two World Cup Final competitions besides four senior ISSF World Cups.
The ranges in India will be busy throughout 2025 with the first-ever Shooting League of India (SLI) also planned in the first half of the year, besides regular national competitions which take place throughout the year culminating in the nationals, the NRAI informed in the release.

Title: Death toll from German Christmas market car-ramming rises to four
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 11:41:28 +0000
Content: The death toll from a car-ramming at a German Christmas market in the city of Magdeburg rose to four on Saturday, according to German newspaper Bild, after a suspect on Friday ploughed into a large crowd of visitors.
German authorities are investigating a Saudi doctor, arrested as the suspected driver of the car, with Der Spiegel magazine reporting he had sympathies with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
Over 60 people were injured, some of them seriously, when a vehicle drove through crowds gathered at a market in the central city, local officials said. A young child was among the dead.
Police said they arrested a 50-year-old from Saudi Arabia who has been living in Germany for almost two decades. Police did not name the man and were not immediately available to comment on the reported rise in the death toll.
The man worked as a doctor in a nearby town, local officials said. Police searched his home overnight.
A Saudi source told Reuters that Saudi Arabia had warned German authorities about the attacker after he posted extremist views on his personal X account that threatened peace and security.
Der Spiegel reported that the suspect had sympathised with the AfD. The magazine did not say where it got the information.
Germany’s domestic intelligence agency was not immediately available for comment.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is scheduled to visit Magdeburg later Saturday.
The attack comes at a time of heightened debate over migration and security in Germany, which is gearing up for a snap election on Feb. 23.
The AfD, currently polling in second place behind the conservative opposition, has led calls for a crackdown on migration to the country.
AfD chancellor candidate Alice Weidel condemned the attack and said on X, “The pictures from #Magdeburg are shocking! My thoughts are with the bereaved and injured. When will this madness come to an end?”

Title: India’s forest cover increases by 1,445 square km, ISFR 2023 shows
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 09:04:48 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Bhupender Yadav, on Saturday released the ‘India State of Forest Report 2023’ (ISFR 2023) at the Forest Research Institute in Dehradun. This report, published biennially by the Forest Survey of India (FSI) since 1987, offers a comprehensive assessment of India’s forest and tree resources, based on satellite data and field-based surveys. The 2023 report marks the 18th edition of this significant publication.
The ISFR 2023 provides crucial information on the country’s forest cover, tree cover, mangrove cover, growing stock, carbon stock, and instances of forest fires. It also highlights the role of agroforestry in India. According to the latest assessment, the total forest and tree cover in India stands at 827,357 square kilometers, representing 25.17 percent of the country’s total geographical area. Of this, 715,343 square kilometers (21.76%) is classified as forest cover, while 112,014 square kilometers (3.41%) is tree cover.
Yadav expressed satisfaction over the increase in the country’s forest and tree cover, which has grown by 1,445 square kilometers since the 2021 assessment. This includes an increase of 156 square kilometers in forest cover and 1,289 square kilometers in tree cover. He also emphasized the advanced technology used by FSI for real-time fire alerts and forest fire services, which help in better forest management.
In terms of the top-performing states, Chhattisgarh led with an increase of 684 square kilometers in forest and tree cover, followed by Uttar Pradesh and Odisha, each with a 559 square kilometer increase, and Rajasthan, with a 394 square kilometer increase. Mizoram, Gujarat, and Odisha were the top three states showing the largest increase in forest cover, with Mizoram seeing an increase of 242 square kilometers, followed by Gujarat (180 square kilometers) and Odisha (152 square kilometers).
The report also provides a state-wise analysis of forest and tree cover, with Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, and Maharashtra leading in total area covered by forests and trees. Madhya Pradesh alone accounts for 85,724 square kilometers of forest and tree cover, while Arunachal Pradesh and Maharashtra follow with 67,083 and 65,383 square kilometers, respectively. In terms of forest cover relative to total geographical area, Lakshadweep (91.33%) has the highest percentage, followed by Mizoram (85.34%) and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands (81.62%).
The assessment also reveals that 19 states and union territories have more than 33 percent of their geographical area under forest cover, with eight states—Mizoram, Lakshadweep, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Manipur—boasting forest cover exceeding 75 percent.
In terms of other environmental resources, India’s mangrove cover is estimated at 4,992 square kilometers. The growing stock, which includes timber and other forest products, has increased by 262 million cubic meters compared to the previous assessment. Bamboo-bearing areas have also seen growth, with an increase of 5,227 square kilometers, reaching a total of 154,670 square kilometers. The potential annual timber production from trees outside forests has been estimated at 91.51 million cubic meters.
The carbon stock in India’s forests is another key highlight of the report. The current estimate stands at 7,285.5 million tonnes, marking an increase of 81.5 million tonnes from the last assessment. Furthermore, the report shows that India has already exceeded its carbon sequestration target under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), with a carbon stock of 30.43 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent, surpassing the 2.29 billion tonnes of additional carbon sink goal set for 2030.
The ISFR 2023 not only offers valuable insights into the health of India’s forests but also serves as a vital resource for policymakers, environmental planners, state forest departments, research organizations, and academic institutions. It provides essential data that aids in the conservation and sustainable management of the country’s natural resources.

The Indian Embassy in Argentina announced its plans to combine yoga, gastronomy, and Indian culture to celebrate the occasion. The event highlighted India’s leadership in promoting human well-being, rooted in the country’s civilizational ethos of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” — the belief that the whole world is one family.
Reflecting on the Winter Solstice at the UN, Harish explained its importance in Indian tradition, marking the beginning of “uttarayana,” a time for spiritual reflection. He concluded that India’s leadership in human well-being is a result of its ancient wisdom and the global importance of peace and unity.

Title: Sri Sri Ravi Shankar brings peace through meditation to UN headquarters consumed by global turmoil
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 06:57:39 +0000
Content: Eighteen minutes of tranquility descended on the world organisation’s headquarters consumed by global turmoil as Sri Sri Ravi Shankar led a meditation session as a path to peace at the United Nations.
At that very moment on Friday, the Security Council down the corridor was grappling with “threats to international peace and security” in a bitter debate, having earlier in the day disposed of topics like “children in armed conflicts”, the tensions in the Middle East and Africa, and the Ukraine War.
In the oasis of peace at the Trusteeship Council Chamber, Ravi Shankar presided over the ‘Meditation for Global Peace and Harmony’ on the eve of World Meditation Day newly minted by the General Assembly this month.
He noted that there are a lot of discussions about peace and security at the UN, and meditation can bring inner security and inner peace to make the world a much better place.
“I urge all the nations here to put a little more attention in peace education. Let us educate our young people, how to relax, how to get rid of tensions on a daily basis, how to manage their negative emotions, and be centered”, said Ravi Shankar, who founded the Art of Living Foundation.
The General Assembly adopted by acclamation on December 6 the resolution moved by a core group of India, Liechtenstein, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Mexico, and Andorra, and joined by many others to declare the Winter Solstice Day the World Meditation Day.
It bookends with the International Day of Yoga on Summer Solstice Day, which was also declared by the General Assembly at India’s initiative.
General Assembly President Philemon Yang said, “Meditation transcends borders, faiths, traditions, and time, offering each of us the opportunity to pause, to listen, and to connect with our inner selves.”
“In its silence, meditation speaks a universal truth: That we are all human, all seeking balance, and all striving for a better understanding of our inner self and the world in which we live”, he said.
Under-Secretary-General Atul Khare said that the UN peacekeepers are “tasked with protecting civilians against physical violence, and are often themselves exposed to atrocities, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is critical that their mental health is taken care of and for this the UN introduced an app in 16 languages that includes meditation to help them.”
India’s Permanent Representative P. Harish said, “The ancient Indian practice of ‘Dhyana’, or meditation, goes back thousands of years to yogic traditions and holds the key to achieve inner calm and attain harmony between mind and body, thought and action, humanity and the external world.”
The winter solstice in the Indian tradition, “is the beginning of ‘uttarayana’, an auspicious time of the year, especially for inner reflection”, he said.
“India’s leadership in overall human well-being stems from our civilisational dictum of Vasudaiva Kutumbakam or the whole world is one family”, he added.

Title: What is US birthright citizenship and can Trump end it?
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 05:36:27 +0000
Content: Donald Trump has said he plans to end birthright citizenship as part of his promised crackdown on immigration when he becomes president on Jan. 20.
Below is a look at U.S. birthright citizenship and Trump’s legal authority to restrict it.
WHAT IS BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP?
Anyone born in the United States is considered a citizen at birth, which derives from the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment, which was added to the Constitution in 1868. The amendment states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 also defines citizens and includes similar language.
There were an estimated 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally in January 2022, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimate, a figure that some analysts now place at 13 million to 14 million. Their U.S.-born children are considered by the government to have U.S. citizenship. Trump has complained about foreign women visiting the United States for the purpose of giving birth and conferring U.S. citizenship on their offspring.
ARE THERE EXCEPTIONS?
Yes. People born in the United States to a foreign diplomatic officer with diplomatic immunity are not U.S. citizens because they are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.
WHAT HAS THE SUPREME COURT SAID?
The Supreme Court has not addressed whether the Citizenship Clause applies to U.S.-born children of people who are in the United States illegally.
The main birthright citizenship case is from 1898, when the Supreme Court ruled that the son of lawful immigrants from China was a U.S. citizen by virtue of his birth in 1873 in San Francisco. The man, Wong Kim Ark, had been denied re-entry to the United States after a visit to China at a time when immigration from China was severely restricted.
The Supreme Court also ruled in 1884 in a dispute over voter registration that U.S.-born John Elk was not a citizen because he was born as a member of a Native American tribe and therefore not subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Congress extended U.S. citizenship to Native Americans in 1924.
WHAT IS THE VIEW OF OPPONENTS OF BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP?
Some scholars argue that if lawmakers wanted all people born in the country to be citizens, they would not have added the clause to the 14th Amendment specifying that citizens “be subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States.
They argue that this language excludes people who entered the country illegally and by implications, their U.S.-born children. Republican senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Tom Cotton from Arkansas proposed bills this year that defined U.S.-born children as not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the U.S. if their parents were in the country illegally.
Most scholars are dismissive of that interpretation of the jurisdiction language. Unlike diplomats, people in the country illegally do not have legal immunity and are subject to the U.S. laws.
CAN TRUMP END BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP WITH AN EXECUTIVE ORDER?
The Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate citizenship, and no president has ever tried to redefine the rules of citizenship using executive orders, though Trump promised to do so in his first term.
Trump could issue an executive order to redefine birthright citizenship. Legal experts said he might declare that it requires one parent must be a U.S. citizen, a permanent resident or a member of the military — language that appeared in the Graham bill. He could direct his agencies to withhold passports or other documents and benefits unless the person meets the new requirement.
Anyone denied a document or benefit could challenge it and legal experts said the executive order would almost certainly be blocked immediately in the courts. But it would also put the issue on a path toward the Supreme Court and likely force the justices to determine who is entitled to birthright citizenship.
If courts decided the Constitution protected birthright citizenship, then only an amendment could change that. A Constitutional amendment would require two-thirds of both houses and approval by three-quarters of state legislatures, a process that would likely take years. The Constitution has not been amended since 1992.

Title: Bears colour stock market red ahead of Christmas, time for balanced investment strategy
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 05:17:32 +0000
Content: Indian benchmark indices declined 5 per cent this week amid global selloff, mainly triggered by the US Federal Reserve’s caution approach for rate cuts next year, which resulted in relentless selling by the foreign institutional investors (FIIs).
With this, Sensex lost over 1,000 points in three out of five trading sessions this week, and nearly Rs 17 lakh crore worth of market cap was eroded out of BSE-listed firms.
According to market experts, it had been a dreadful week for the equity markets, as the key indices fell dramatically, erasing the gains of the last four weeks.
“The benchmark index experienced a significant decline, plummeting approximately 1,200 points from the previous week’s closing figure. As a result, it finished the week below 200 simple moving average (SMA), marking a total loss of nearly 5 per cent,” said Osho Krishnan from Angel One.
The Nifty50 experienced a significant decline, as it breached all essential support levels. This downward movement has led the index to approach its most recent swing low, signalling potential volatility in the market.
From a technical standpoint, as Nifty slipped below the pivotal zone of 200 SMA, the next potential support could be seen around the recent swing low around 23,200-23,100, while a decisive breach is likely to open further downside towards 22,800 in the near period, said Krishnan.
The weak global cues initiated the downward move, but the follow-up sell-off showcases the bears’ eagerness to colour the market red ahead of Christmas.
On Friday, Sensex settled at 78,041.59, down by 1,176.46 points or 1.49 per cent, and Nifty ended at 23,587.50, down by 364.20 points, or 1.52 per cent.
Nifty Bank ended at 50,759.20, down by 816.50 points, or 1.58 per cent. The Nifty Midcap 100 index closed at 56,906.75 at the end of trading after dropping 1,649.50 points, or 2.82 per cent.
On the sectoral front, selling was seen in Nifty’s Auto, IT, Fin Services, Pharma, FMCG, Metal, Media, Energy, Private Bank, Infra, Commodities, and PSE sectors.
Considering the recent developments, it is advised to approach markets with proper risk management and refrain from taking complacent bets for the time being, advised experts.
Amid this cautious environment, “we maintain a bullish outlook on new-age, platform-based technology companies,” said Krishna Appala from Capitalmind Research.
A balanced investment strategy that combines the stability and fair valuations of large caps with tactical exposure to profitable, domestic-focused tech companies offers a prudent approach to capturing growth potential while managing geopolitical and policy risks, said experts.

Title: Indian diaspora, 101-year-old former IFS officer greet PM Modi on arrival in Kuwait Kuwait City
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 17:11:55 +0000
Content: The Indian community gave a rousing reception to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he arrived at his hotel in Kuwait City on Saturday afternoon, shortly after he touched down in the Gulf nation, kicking off his historic two-day visit, the first by an Indian PM to the country in 43 years.
Among those who met Prime Minister Modi warmly was 101-year-old Mangal Sain Handa, a former Indian Foreign Service (IFS) officer, who now resides in Kuwait and had served in Kuwait, United Kingdom, Iraq, China, Argentina, and Cambodia before retiring about four decades ago.
PM Modi not only exchanged greetings with Handa but also posed for photos with his family.
On Friday, Handa’s granddaughter, Shreya Juneja had posted a message for PM Modi, requesting him to meet her grandfather during his visit to Kuwait.
On Saturday, just before he boarded Air India One, Prime Minister Modi, who enjoys a massive following not just in the country but also all over the world and loves to give a personal touch to his engagement with the Indian diaspora during foreign visits, responded to Juneja’s social media post.
“Absolutely! I look forward to meeting Mangal Sain Handa Ji in Kuwait today,” wrote PM Modi.
The Prime Minister also received copies of Ramayana and Mahabharata translated in Arabic language by Abdullah Baron and published by Abdullateef Alnesef.
The Indian community, the largest expatriate group in Kuwait, continues to play a pivotal role in strengthening bilateral relations.
In his departure statement on Saturday, PM Modi had mentioned that his visit would be an opportunity to chalk out a roadmap for a futuristic partnership for the benefit of people and the region.
“I eagerly look forward to meeting the Indian diaspora in Kuwait who have immensely contributed to the strengthening of bonds of friendship between the two nations,” said Prime Minister Modi.
The Prime Minister is also scheduled to interact with the Indian diaspora at a community event besides visiting a labour camp during his two-day visit to the West Asian nation.

Title: 55th GST Council Meeting: Tax rate changes and compliance reforms announced
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 17:10:09 +0000
Content: The 55th meeting of the GST Council, chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, was held on Saturday in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan. The meeting, attended by senior officials and representatives from states and union territories, resulted in several significant decisions aimed at tax rate changes, trade facilitation, and compliance streamlining under GST.
The Council recommended a reduction in the GST rate on Fortified Rice Kernel (FRK) to 5%. It also announced a full exemption of GST on gene therapy and contributions made by general insurance companies from third-party motor vehicle premiums to the Motor Vehicle Accident Fund. Additionally, the Council clarified that no GST would be levied on transactions involving vouchers, as they are neither classified as goods nor services. The provisions related to vouchers are set to be simplified further.
In a move to streamline banking operations, the Council declared that penal charges levied by banks and NBFCs for non-compliance with loan terms would not attract GST. Moreover, the Council proposed lowering the pre-deposit amount required for appeals related solely to penalties, reducing it to 10% from the earlier 25%.
Several tax rate revisions were approved, including extending exemptions for specific imports and goods used in government welfare schemes. For instance, the concessional 5% GST rate on food inputs used for free distribution under government programs will continue. The Council also clarified tax classifications for items like popcorn and pepper, resolving ambiguities that had led to disputes.
On the compliance front, significant steps were announced. These included introducing a Track and Trace Mechanism for certain goods to curb tax evasion and mandating the recording of accurate state details for online services provided to unregistered recipients.
Additionally, amendments to the CGST Act and Rules were proposed to improve input tax credit claims, clarify procedures, and address issues related to vouchers and reconciliation statements. The Council also agreed to amend provisions related to the Input Services Distributor mechanism and enable temporary identification numbers for unregistered entities required to make tax payments.
The Council emphasized procedural improvements, such as linking the GST rate on restaurant services in hotels to the previous year’s value of supply, effective April 1, 2025. Furthermore, it discussed measures to operationalize the GST Appellate Tribunal (GSTAT) and streamline IGST settlement issues.
In response to requests from states like Andhra Pradesh, a Group of Ministers will be formed to examine policies for levies related to natural disasters. The Council also extended timelines for specific committees and deferred discussions on certain municipal charges.

Title: India has skill, technology, manpower that ‘New’ Kuwait needs: PM Modi
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 16:58:29 +0000
Content: Noting that Kuwait wants to become a dynamic economy and India aims to be a developed country by 2047, PM Modi said on Saturday that India has the skill, technology, innovation and manpower that ‘New’ Kuwait needs..”
Addressing the community program ‘Hala Modi’ in Kuwait, PM Modi said the relationship that was built by culture and commerce is scaling new heights today.
“People from North, West, East and South, who speak different languages are here- ‘lekin sab ke dil me ek hi goonj hai – Bharat Mata Ki Jai’…This is a special moment for me. After 43 years, more than four decades, an Indian Prime Minister has come to Kuwait. It takes four hours to reach Kuwait from India but it took four decades for the Prime Minister,” he said.
“I have reached Kuwait just two and a half hours ago, since the time I have stepped here, I am feeling a different sense of belonging, a different warmth all around. You all have come from different states of India, but seeing all of you, it seems as if a mini Hindustan has come in front of me,” he added.
The Prime Minister said India and Kuwait will become partners in prosperity.
“In the decades to come, we will become partners in our prosperity. Our goals aren’t different! The people of Kuwait are building New Kuwait. The people of Bharat are working to build India into a developed nation by 2047. Through trade and innovation, Kuwait wants to become a dynamic economy. India is focussing on innovation and strengthening its economy. Both goals support each other,” he said.
“In the past, the relationship that was built by culture and commerce is scaling new heights today. Today, Kuwait is an important energy and trade partner of India. For the Kuwaiti companies too, India is a huge investment destination. His Highness Crown Prince of Kuwait, during our meeting in New York, said, ‘When you are in need, India is your destination.’ The citizens of India and Kuwait have always helped each other in times of distress,” he said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Kuwait to a warm welcome on Saturday. He is on a two-day visit to the Gulf nation.
On his arrival, PM Modi was received by Kuwait’s first Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence and Interior, Sheikh Fahad Yousef Saud Al-Sabah, along with the country’s Foreign Minister Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya, and several other dignitaries.
In his departure statement, PM Modi said he looks forward to his meetings with the Amir of Kuwait, the Crown Prince and the country’s Prime Minister.
He said the meetings will provide an opportunity to chalk out a roadmap for a futuristic partnership for the benefit of the people of the two countries and the region.
PM Modi said he eagerly looks forward to meeting the Indian diaspora in Kuwait who have immensely contributed to strengthening of bonds of friendship between the two nations.

Title: Ukraine collects vast war data trove to train AI models
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 12:28:00 +0000
Content: As the future of warfare pivots towards artificial intelligence, Ukraine is sitting on a valuable resource: millions of hours of footage from drones which can be used to train AI models to make decisions on the battlefield.
AI has been deployed by both sides on the battlefield during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to identify targets, scanning images far quicker than a human can.
Oleksandr Dmitriev, founder of OCHI, a non-profit Ukrainian digital system which centralises and analyses video feeds from over 15,000 drone crews working on the frontlines, told Reuters his system had collected 2 million hours, or 228 years, of battlefield video from drones since 2022.
That will provide vital data for AI to learn from.
“This is food for the AI: If you want to teach an AI, you give it 2 million hours (of video), it will become something supernatural.”
According to Dmitriev, the footage can be used to train AI models in combat tactics, spotting targets and assessing the effectiveness of weapons systems.
“It is essentially experience which can be turned into mathematics,” he said, adding that an AI program can study the trajectories and angles at which weapons are most effective.
The system was originally made in 2022 to give military commanders an overview of their areas of the battlefield by showing them drone footage from all nearby crews side by side on one screen.
After the system was rolled out, the team running it realised that video being sent back by drones could prove useful as a record of the war – so they began to store it.
On average, Dmitriev said five or six terabytes of new data were added every day from the fighting.
IMAGE QUALITY
Dmitriev said he was talking with representatives from some of Ukraine’s foreign allies that had expressed interest in his OCHI system, but declined to provide details.
Samuel Bendett, adjunct senior fellow at the U.S.-based Center for a New American Security, said such a vast pool of data would be extremely valuable in teaching AI systems to identify what exactly they are seeing, and what steps they should take.
“Humans can do this intuitively, but machines cannot, and they have to be trained on what is or isn’t a road, or a natural obstacle, or an ambush,” he said.
Kateryna Bondar, a fellow at Wadhwani AI centre at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the size of the data set and the image quality were important, as AI models learned to recognise targets based on shapes and colours.
Bondar said that the dataset was valuable in the context of training to fight Russia. However, she said U.S. officials and drone makers prefer a dataset that trains AI systems to operate in the Pacific against a potential Chinese adversary.
“(They want) systems ready and able to fight against China because that’s the main priority for the U.S. right now, rather than getting a lot of footage of Ukrainian fields and forests.”
Ukraine also has another system, called Avengers, developed by its defence ministry, which centralises and collects video from drones and CCTV.
The ministry declined to provide information about this system. However, it has previously said that Avengers spots 12,000 Russian pieces of equipment a week using AI identification tools.
Thousands of drones are already using AI systems to fly themselves into targets without human piloting, and Ukraine is using AI technologies to help demine its territory.
Ukrainian companies are developing drone swarms, where a computer system will be able to execute commands for an interlinked cloud of dozens of drones.
Russia has also touted its use of battlefield AI, most notably for target recognition in Lancet strike drones, which have proved lethal against Ukrainian armoured vehicles.

Title: Shooting sport: India to host ISSF Junior World Cup for the first time in 2025
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 12:24:51 +0000
Content: India will be hosting the International Shooting Sport Federation (ISSF) Junior World Cup for the first time in the second half of 2025. The ISSF awarded the hosting rights for the top junior international shooting competition for Rifle/Pistol/Shotgun to the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI), making it another achievement for the country in shooting sport
This will be the third top ISSF-level event to be held in India after the senior World Cup in Bhopal in 2023 and the season-ending ISSF World Cup Final earlier this year, reinforcing India’s stature as one of the sport’s top destinations in the world, the NRAI informed in a release on Saturday.
Reacting to the development after the NRAI received the official confirmation letter from the ISSF on Friday, NRAI President Kalikesh Narayan Singh Deo said, “We had a very fruitful executive committee meeting of the ISSF in Rome last month and all member federations as well as the ISSF President Luciano Rossi were all praise with the way India has been hosting top international Shooting competitions and helping to grow the sport globally.
“We obviously got the sense then but now that the official confirmation has come, we are excited and energised to put our best foot forward as usual. We are of course indebted to the Government of India and the Ministry of Sports for supporting in every possible way, our efforts to grow the sport in the country,” he said.
K. Sultan Singh, Secretary General, NRAI, elaborated on the details of the ISSF communique saying, “The ISSF in their letter have requested us to confirm two possible convenient slots, one in September-October and the other during the end October-beginning November period. We will, after meeting internally, share the same with them at the earliest so that member federations can prepare accordingly. The world’s top future champions and stars of Shooting are going to converge in India for a blockbuster showdown and we are confident that it will give the sport another grassroots boost in the country.”
This will be the ninth top-level shooting championship to be held in India over the past decade, and it will be the first ISSF Junior World Cup. Before this India had hosted continental championships and six ISSF competitions, including two World Cup Final competitions besides four senior ISSF World Cups.
The ranges in India will be busy throughout 2025 with the first-ever Shooting League of India (SLI) also planned in the first half of the year, besides regular national competitions which take place throughout the year culminating in the nationals, the NRAI informed in the release.

Title: Death toll from German Christmas market car-ramming rises to four
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 11:41:28 +0000
Content: The death toll from a car-ramming at a German Christmas market in the city of Magdeburg rose to four on Saturday, according to German newspaper Bild, after a suspect on Friday ploughed into a large crowd of visitors.
German authorities are investigating a Saudi doctor, arrested as the suspected driver of the car, with Der Spiegel magazine reporting he had sympathies with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.
Over 60 people were injured, some of them seriously, when a vehicle drove through crowds gathered at a market in the central city, local officials said. A young child was among the dead.
Police said they arrested a 50-year-old from Saudi Arabia who has been living in Germany for almost two decades. Police did not name the man and were not immediately available to comment on the reported rise in the death toll.
The man worked as a doctor in a nearby town, local officials said. Police searched his home overnight.
A Saudi source told Reuters that Saudi Arabia had warned German authorities about the attacker after he posted extremist views on his personal X account that threatened peace and security.
Der Spiegel reported that the suspect had sympathised with the AfD. The magazine did not say where it got the information.
Germany’s domestic intelligence agency was not immediately available for comment.
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is scheduled to visit Magdeburg later Saturday.
The attack comes at a time of heightened debate over migration and security in Germany, which is gearing up for a snap election on Feb. 23.
The AfD, currently polling in second place behind the conservative opposition, has led calls for a crackdown on migration to the country.
AfD chancellor candidate Alice Weidel condemned the attack and said on X, “The pictures from #Magdeburg are shocking! My thoughts are with the bereaved and injured. When will this madness come to an end?”

Title: India’s forest cover increases by 1,445 square km, ISFR 2023 shows
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 09:04:48 +0000
Content: Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change, Bhupender Yadav, on Saturday released the ‘India State of Forest Report 2023’ (ISFR 2023) at the Forest Research Institute in Dehradun. This report, published biennially by the Forest Survey of India (FSI) since 1987, offers a comprehensive assessment of India’s forest and tree resources, based on satellite data and field-based surveys. The 2023 report marks the 18th edition of this significant publication.
The ISFR 2023 provides crucial information on the country’s forest cover, tree cover, mangrove cover, growing stock, carbon stock, and instances of forest fires. It also highlights the role of agroforestry in India. According to the latest assessment, the total forest and tree cover in India stands at 827,357 square kilometers, representing 25.17 percent of the country’s total geographical area. Of this, 715,343 square kilometers (21.76%) is classified as forest cover, while 112,014 square kilometers (3.41%) is tree cover.
Yadav expressed satisfaction over the increase in the country’s forest and tree cover, which has grown by 1,445 square kilometers since the 2021 assessment. This includes an increase of 156 square kilometers in forest cover and 1,289 square kilometers in tree cover. He also emphasized the advanced technology used by FSI for real-time fire alerts and forest fire services, which help in better forest management.
In terms of the top-performing states, Chhattisgarh led with an increase of 684 square kilometers in forest and tree cover, followed by Uttar Pradesh and Odisha, each with a 559 square kilometer increase, and Rajasthan, with a 394 square kilometer increase. Mizoram, Gujarat, and Odisha were the top three states showing the largest increase in forest cover, with Mizoram seeing an increase of 242 square kilometers, followed by Gujarat (180 square kilometers) and Odisha (152 square kilometers).
The report also provides a state-wise analysis of forest and tree cover, with Madhya Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, and Maharashtra leading in total area covered by forests and trees. Madhya Pradesh alone accounts for 85,724 square kilometers of forest and tree cover, while Arunachal Pradesh and Maharashtra follow with 67,083 and 65,383 square kilometers, respectively. In terms of forest cover relative to total geographical area, Lakshadweep (91.33%) has the highest percentage, followed by Mizoram (85.34%) and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands (81.62%).
The assessment also reveals that 19 states and union territories have more than 33 percent of their geographical area under forest cover, with eight states—Mizoram, Lakshadweep, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Manipur—boasting forest cover exceeding 75 percent.
In terms of other environmental resources, India’s mangrove cover is estimated at 4,992 square kilometers. The growing stock, which includes timber and other forest products, has increased by 262 million cubic meters compared to the previous assessment. Bamboo-bearing areas have also seen growth, with an increase of 5,227 square kilometers, reaching a total of 154,670 square kilometers. The potential annual timber production from trees outside forests has been estimated at 91.51 million cubic meters.
The carbon stock in India’s forests is another key highlight of the report. The current estimate stands at 7,285.5 million tonnes, marking an increase of 81.5 million tonnes from the last assessment. Furthermore, the report shows that India has already exceeded its carbon sequestration target under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), with a carbon stock of 30.43 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent, surpassing the 2.29 billion tonnes of additional carbon sink goal set for 2030.
The ISFR 2023 not only offers valuable insights into the health of India’s forests but also serves as a vital resource for policymakers, environmental planners, state forest departments, research organizations, and academic institutions. It provides essential data that aids in the conservation and sustainable management of the country’s natural resources.

Title: Indian Missions worldwide celebrate first World Meditation Day
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 08:01:33 +0000
Content: Indian missions around the world celebrated the inaugural World Meditation Day on Saturday, December 21, highlighting meditation’s transformative impact on mental and physical well-being. The event was marked by a series of activities and ceremonies, with prominent global figures and diplomats emphasizing the practice’s ability to foster peace, harmony, and personal growth.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a post on X, urged everyone to incorporate meditation into their daily routines. He described meditation as a “powerful way to bring peace and harmony” to individuals, societies, and the planet as a whole. In his post, he encouraged people to use modern tools such as apps and guided videos to help integrate meditation into their lives.
“Meditation is a powerful way to bring peace and harmony to one’s life, as well as to our society and planet. In the age of technology, Apps and guided videos can be valuable tools to help incorporate meditation into our routines,” Modi wrote.
At the United Nations, India hosted a special event titled “Meditation for Global Peace and Harmony” at the UN Trusteeship Council. India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, P. Harish, addressed the gathering, emphasizing the importance of Dhyana (meditation), an ancient Indian practice that promotes inner calm and balance.
Harish expressed pride in the global recognition of meditation, particularly the UN General Assembly’s adoption of December 21 as World Meditation Day. The resolution, passed on December 6, was the result of a collaborative effort among a core group of countries, including India, Liechtenstein, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Mexico, and Andorra. Harish noted that notable personalities such as UN General Assembly President Philemon Yang, Under-Secretary-General for Operational Support Atul Khare, and spiritual leader Sri Sri Ravi Shankar participated in the event.
In Vientiane, Laos, the Indian Embassy, in collaboration with Art of Living Laos and the Holiday Inn Vientiane, celebrated the day with a meditation session. Indian Ambassador Prashant Agrawal encouraged attendees to adopt meditation for peace, harmony, and well-being. He also highlighted India’s central role in the adoption of World Meditation Day at the UN.
The Nepal Mission to the United Nations also marked the occasion by emphasizing Nepal’s spiritual heritage. Nepal’s Permanent Representative to the UN, Lok Thapa, described the country as “Tapobhumi” (the land of meditation) and highlighted how meditation can bring people together and foster harmony across communities.
The Consulate General of India in Sao Paulo hosted a meditation session at the Swami Vivekananda Cultural Centre (SVCC), where Consul General Hansraj Singh Verma spoke about the significance of meditation. Dr. Luisa Gondim from Art of Living led the participants in a short meditation practice.
In Johannesburg, the Indian Embassy encouraged everyone to embrace mindfulness, posting a message on social media, “Even a few minutes of mindfulness can make a big difference. Find your inner peace on World Meditation Day!”
Other missions, including those in Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, and Argentina, also celebrated the day with meditation sessions, discussions, and cultural events, all aimed at promoting peace and well-being through meditation.
The Indian Embassy in Argentina announced its plans to combine yoga, gastronomy, and Indian culture to celebrate the occasion. The event highlighted India’s leadership in promoting human well-being, rooted in the country’s civilizational ethos of “Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam” — the belief that the whole world is one family.
Reflecting on the Winter Solstice at the UN, Harish explained its importance in Indian tradition, marking the beginning of “uttarayana,” a time for spiritual reflection. He concluded that India’s leadership in human well-being is a result of its ancient wisdom and the global importance of peace and unity.

Title: Sri Sri Ravi Shankar brings peace through meditation to UN headquarters consumed by global turmoil
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 06:57:39 +0000
Content: Eighteen minutes of tranquility descended on the world organisation’s headquarters consumed by global turmoil as Sri Sri Ravi Shankar led a meditation session as a path to peace at the United Nations.
At that very moment on Friday, the Security Council down the corridor was grappling with “threats to international peace and security” in a bitter debate, having earlier in the day disposed of topics like “children in armed conflicts”, the tensions in the Middle East and Africa, and the Ukraine War.
In the oasis of peace at the Trusteeship Council Chamber, Ravi Shankar presided over the ‘Meditation for Global Peace and Harmony’ on the eve of World Meditation Day newly minted by the General Assembly this month.
He noted that there are a lot of discussions about peace and security at the UN, and meditation can bring inner security and inner peace to make the world a much better place.
“I urge all the nations here to put a little more attention in peace education. Let us educate our young people, how to relax, how to get rid of tensions on a daily basis, how to manage their negative emotions, and be centered”, said Ravi Shankar, who founded the Art of Living Foundation.
The General Assembly adopted by acclamation on December 6 the resolution moved by a core group of India, Liechtenstein, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Mexico, and Andorra, and joined by many others to declare the Winter Solstice Day the World Meditation Day.
It bookends with the International Day of Yoga on Summer Solstice Day, which was also declared by the General Assembly at India’s initiative.
General Assembly President Philemon Yang said, “Meditation transcends borders, faiths, traditions, and time, offering each of us the opportunity to pause, to listen, and to connect with our inner selves.”
“In its silence, meditation speaks a universal truth: That we are all human, all seeking balance, and all striving for a better understanding of our inner self and the world in which we live”, he said.
Under-Secretary-General Atul Khare said that the UN peacekeepers are “tasked with protecting civilians against physical violence, and are often themselves exposed to atrocities, war crimes and crimes against humanity. It is critical that their mental health is taken care of and for this the UN introduced an app in 16 languages that includes meditation to help them.”
India’s Permanent Representative P. Harish said, “The ancient Indian practice of ‘Dhyana’, or meditation, goes back thousands of years to yogic traditions and holds the key to achieve inner calm and attain harmony between mind and body, thought and action, humanity and the external world.”
The winter solstice in the Indian tradition, “is the beginning of ‘uttarayana’, an auspicious time of the year, especially for inner reflection”, he said.
“India’s leadership in overall human well-being stems from our civilisational dictum of Vasudaiva Kutumbakam or the whole world is one family”, he added.

Title: What is US birthright citizenship and can Trump end it?
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 05:36:27 +0000
Content: Donald Trump has said he plans to end birthright citizenship as part of his promised crackdown on immigration when he becomes president on Jan. 20.
Below is a look at U.S. birthright citizenship and Trump’s legal authority to restrict it.
WHAT IS BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP?
Anyone born in the United States is considered a citizen at birth, which derives from the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment, which was added to the Constitution in 1868. The amendment states: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.” The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 also defines citizens and includes similar language.
There were an estimated 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally in January 2022, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimate, a figure that some analysts now place at 13 million to 14 million. Their U.S.-born children are considered by the government to have U.S. citizenship. Trump has complained about foreign women visiting the United States for the purpose of giving birth and conferring U.S. citizenship on their offspring.
ARE THERE EXCEPTIONS?
Yes. People born in the United States to a foreign diplomatic officer with diplomatic immunity are not U.S. citizens because they are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.
WHAT HAS THE SUPREME COURT SAID?
The Supreme Court has not addressed whether the Citizenship Clause applies to U.S.-born children of people who are in the United States illegally.
The main birthright citizenship case is from 1898, when the Supreme Court ruled that the son of lawful immigrants from China was a U.S. citizen by virtue of his birth in 1873 in San Francisco. The man, Wong Kim Ark, had been denied re-entry to the United States after a visit to China at a time when immigration from China was severely restricted.
The Supreme Court also ruled in 1884 in a dispute over voter registration that U.S.-born John Elk was not a citizen because he was born as a member of a Native American tribe and therefore not subject to U.S. jurisdiction. Congress extended U.S. citizenship to Native Americans in 1924.
WHAT IS THE VIEW OF OPPONENTS OF BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP?
Some scholars argue that if lawmakers wanted all people born in the country to be citizens, they would not have added the clause to the 14th Amendment specifying that citizens “be subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States.
They argue that this language excludes people who entered the country illegally and by implications, their U.S.-born children. Republican senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Tom Cotton from Arkansas proposed bills this year that defined U.S.-born children as not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the U.S. if their parents were in the country illegally.
Most scholars are dismissive of that interpretation of the jurisdiction language. Unlike diplomats, people in the country illegally do not have legal immunity and are subject to the U.S. laws.
CAN TRUMP END BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP WITH AN EXECUTIVE ORDER?
The Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate citizenship, and no president has ever tried to redefine the rules of citizenship using executive orders, though Trump promised to do so in his first term.
Trump could issue an executive order to redefine birthright citizenship. Legal experts said he might declare that it requires one parent must be a U.S. citizen, a permanent resident or a member of the military — language that appeared in the Graham bill. He could direct his agencies to withhold passports or other documents and benefits unless the person meets the new requirement.
Anyone denied a document or benefit could challenge it and legal experts said the executive order would almost certainly be blocked immediately in the courts. But it would also put the issue on a path toward the Supreme Court and likely force the justices to determine who is entitled to birthright citizenship.
If courts decided the Constitution protected birthright citizenship, then only an amendment could change that. A Constitutional amendment would require two-thirds of both houses and approval by three-quarters of state legislatures, a process that would likely take years. The Constitution has not been amended since 1992.

Earlier, a victim of the incident, Drishti Verma, succumbed to her injuries. “She was rescued from the debris by the National Disaster Management Force (NDRF) in critical condition and rushed to Sohana Hospital,” said Viraj S. Tidke, officiating Deputy Commissioner.
Rescue operations by personnel from the Indian Army and NDRF continued on Sunday, a day after the collapse. Meanwhile, an FIR was registered against the building’s owners.

Title: Atletico go top as late Sorloth goal earns dramatic 2-1 win at Barcelona
Publication Date: Sun, 22 Dec 2024 05:08:37 +0000
Content: Alexander Sorloth struck deep in stoppage time to hand Atletico Madrid a 2-1 comeback win at Barcelona on Saturday that moved them top of LaLiga with their 12th consecutive victory across all competitions.
Pedri put the hosts ahead in the first half but Rodrigo De Paul levelled after the break before Sorloth inflicted a third straight home league defeat on Barca and knocked them off the LaLiga summit.
It was Atletico’s first away win at Barcelona in 18 years and they now have 41 points with a game in hand, three ahead of the Catalans who have gone three league games without a win.
“It’s very tough. We had chances to seal the win. If you don’t put the game to bed, this happens,” Pedri told Movistar.
“Our home is where it has to be difficult to beat us. We have to improve a lot. We have to reset ourselves mentally and physically.”
Barca were the better side in the opening exchanges and Pedri scored on the half-hour mark following a great run into the box and a one-two with Gavi, beating goalkeeper Jan Oblak with a low shot.
Despite their dominance, the hosts were unable to extend their lead after the break as Raphinha’s chip hit the crossbar and Oblak blocked Fermin Lopez’s close-range shot with his feet.
Robert Lewandowski also failed to find the net as his poor shot from inside the six-yard box was also saved by Oblak.
De Paul then grabbed the equaliser in the 60th minute, capitalising on a poor clearance by Marc Casado on the edge of the box to slot his shot into the bottom corner with what was only Atletico’s second attempt on goal in the game.
“When you suffer more, you enjoy it more. We were up against a great rival. It had been many years since Atletico had won here, and we were also playing for the top spot,” De Paul said.
“It’s exciting to be leaders. It’s a huge satisfaction. When your work pays off, you feel completely satisfied. It’s an honour to wear this shirt, and when things go well it gives me great joy.”
Oblak pulled off a couple of key saves to deny Raphinha and Pedri before substitute Sorloth netted with a first-time effort six minutes into stoppage time from a deep cross by Nahuel Molina.
“I hadn’t won in Barcelona since I arrived, finally. It was difficult, but we got three points. Let’s continue in this vein,” Oblak said.
“We started badly, with some fear that nobody understands, because we are in very good shape. After the 1-0 we were able to hold on without conceding the second.
“The league is very long. Today is not key, it’s three points and there are a lot of points left. A month and a half ago we were far away and now we are here.”

Title: 55th GST Council Meeting: Tax rate changes and compliance reforms announced
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 17:10:09 +0000
Content: The 55th meeting of the GST Council, chaired by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, was held on Saturday in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan. The meeting, attended by senior officials and representatives from states and union territories, resulted in several significant decisions aimed at tax rate changes, trade facilitation, and compliance streamlining under GST.
The Council recommended a reduction in the GST rate on Fortified Rice Kernel (FRK) to 5%. It also announced a full exemption of GST on gene therapy and contributions made by general insurance companies from third-party motor vehicle premiums to the Motor Vehicle Accident Fund. Additionally, the Council clarified that no GST would be levied on transactions involving vouchers, as they are neither classified as goods nor services. The provisions related to vouchers are set to be simplified further.
In a move to streamline banking operations, the Council declared that penal charges levied by banks and NBFCs for non-compliance with loan terms would not attract GST. Moreover, the Council proposed lowering the pre-deposit amount required for appeals related solely to penalties, reducing it to 10% from the earlier 25%.
Several tax rate revisions were approved, including extending exemptions for specific imports and goods used in government welfare schemes. For instance, the concessional 5% GST rate on food inputs used for free distribution under government programs will continue. The Council also clarified tax classifications for items like popcorn and pepper, resolving ambiguities that had led to disputes.
On the compliance front, significant steps were announced. These included introducing a Track and Trace Mechanism for certain goods to curb tax evasion and mandating the recording of accurate state details for online services provided to unregistered recipients.
Additionally, amendments to the CGST Act and Rules were proposed to improve input tax credit claims, clarify procedures, and address issues related to vouchers and reconciliation statements. The Council also agreed to amend provisions related to the Input Services Distributor mechanism and enable temporary identification numbers for unregistered entities required to make tax payments.
The Council emphasized procedural improvements, such as linking the GST rate on restaurant services in hotels to the previous year’s value of supply, effective April 1, 2025. Furthermore, it discussed measures to operationalize the GST Appellate Tribunal (GSTAT) and streamline IGST settlement issues.
In response to requests from states like Andhra Pradesh, a Group of Ministers will be formed to examine policies for levies related to natural disasters. The Council also extended timelines for specific committees and deferred discussions on certain municipal charges.

After 43 years, more than four decades, an Indian Prime Minister has come to Kuwait. It takes four hours to reach Kuwait from India but it took four decades for the Prime Minister,” he said.
“I have reached Kuwait just two and a half hours ago, since the time I have stepped here, I am feeling a different sense of belonging, a different warmth all around. You all have come from different states of India, but seeing all of you, it seems as if a mini Hindustan has come in front of me,” he added.
The Prime Minister said India and Kuwait will become partners in prosperity.
“In the decades to come, we will become partners in our prosperity. Our goals aren’t different! The people of Kuwait are building New Kuwait. The people of Bharat are working to build India into a developed nation by 2047. Through trade and innovation, Kuwait wants to become a dynamic economy. India is focussing on innovation and strengthening its economy. Both goals support each other,” he said.
“In the past, the relationship that was built by culture and commerce is scaling new heights today. Today, Kuwait is an important energy and trade partner of India. For the Kuwaiti companies too, India is a huge investment destination. His Highness Crown Prince of Kuwait, during our meeting in New York, said, ‘When you are in need, India is your destination.’ The citizens of India and Kuwait have always helped each other in times of distress,” he said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Kuwait to a warm welcome on Saturday. He is on a two-day visit to the Gulf nation.
On his arrival, PM Modi was received by Kuwait’s first Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence and Interior, Sheikh Fahad Yousef Saud Al-Sabah, along with the country’s Foreign Minister Abdullah Ali Al-Yahya, and several other dignitaries.
In his departure statement, PM Modi said he looks forward to his meetings with the Amir of Kuwait, the Crown Prince and the country’s Prime Minister.
He said the meetings will provide an opportunity to chalk out a roadmap for a futuristic partnership for the benefit of the people of the two countries and the region.
PM Modi said he eagerly looks forward to meeting the Indian diaspora in Kuwait who have immensely contributed to strengthening of bonds of friendship between the two nations.

Title: Ukraine collects vast war data trove to train AI models
Publication Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2024 12:28:00 +0000
Content: As the future of warfare pivots towards artificial intelligence, Ukraine is sitting on a valuable resource: millions of hours of footage from drones which can be used to train AI models to make decisions on the battlefield.
AI has been deployed by both sides on the battlefield during Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to identify targets, scanning images far quicker than a human can.
Oleksandr Dmitriev, founder of OCHI, a non-profit Ukrainian digital system which centralises and analyses video feeds from over 15,000 drone crews working on the frontlines, told Reuters his system had collected 2 million hours, or 228 years, of battlefield video from drones since 2022.
That will provide vital data for AI to learn from.
“This is food for the AI: If you want to teach an AI, you give it 2 million hours (of video), it will become something supernatural.”
According to Dmitriev, the footage can be used to train AI models in combat tactics, spotting targets and assessing the effectiveness of weapons systems.
“It is essentially experience which can be turned into mathematics,” he said, adding that an AI program can study the trajectories and angles at which weapons are most effective.
The system was originally made in 2022 to give military commanders an overview of their areas of the battlefield by showing them drone footage from all nearby crews side by side on one screen.
After the system was rolled out, the team running it realised that video being sent back by drones could prove useful as a record of the war – so they began to store it.
On average, Dmitriev said five or six terabytes of new data were added every day from the fighting.

Dmitriev said he was talking with representatives from some of Ukraine’s foreign allies that had expressed interest in his OCHI system, but declined to provide details.
Samuel Bendett, adjunct senior fellow at the U.S.-based Center for a New American Security, said such a vast pool of data would be extremely valuable in teaching AI systems to identify what exactly they are seeing, and what steps they should take.
“Humans can do this intuitively, but machines cannot, and they have to be trained on what is or isn’t a road, or a natural obstacle, or an ambush,” he said.
Kateryna Bondar, a fellow at Wadhwani AI centre at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, said the size of the data set and the image quality were important, as AI models learned to recognise targets based on shapes and colours.
Bondar said that the dataset was valuable in the context of training to fight Russia. However, she said U.S. officials and drone makers prefer a dataset that trains AI systems to operate in the Pacific against a potential Chinese adversary.
“(They want) systems ready and able to fight against China because that’s the main priority for the U.S. right now, rather than getting a lot of footage of Ukrainian fields and forests.”
Ukraine also has another system, called Avengers, developed by its defence ministry, which centralises and collects video from drones and CCTV.
The ministry declined to provide information about this system. However, it has previously said that Avengers spots 12,000 Russian pieces of equipment a week using AI identification tools.
Thousands of drones are already using AI systems to fly themselves into targets without human piloting, and Ukraine is using AI technologies to help demine its territory.
Ukrainian companies are developing drone swarms, where a computer system will be able to execute commands for an interlinked cloud of dozens of drones.
Russia has also touted its use of battlefield AI, most notably for target recognition in Lancet strike drones, which have proved lethal against Ukrainian armoured vehicles.
