Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 13:00:20 +0000
Content: Leaders of the Mahayuti alliance were sworn in as cabinet ministers in the Maharashtra government during a ceremony at Raj Bhavan in Nagpur on Sunday.  
The Mahayuti alliance comprises the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and the Shiv Sena. 
BJP leaders, including state unit chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule, Ashish Shelar, Ganesh Naik, Mangal Prabhat Lodha, Pankaja Munde, Girish Mahajan, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, Chandrakant Patil, and Nitesh Rane, took the oath of office.  
Representing Shiv Sena’s Eknath Shinde faction, leaders such as Shambhuraj Desai, Dadaji Dagadu Bhuse, Sanjay Rathod, Uday Samant, Gulabrao Patil, and Sanjay Shirsat were also sworn in. Additionally, NCP leaders Aditi Tatkare, Dhananjay Munde, and Hasan Mushrif joined the Cabinet.  
Maharashtra Governor CP Radhakrishnan administered the oath to the newly inducted ministers, in the presence of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Deputy Chief Ministers Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar.  
This Cabinet expansion occurred over two weeks after CM Fadnavis and his two deputies were sworn in on December 5. The Mahayuti alliance, which commands a significant majority in the Assembly, had faced criticism from the opposition for delaying the Cabinet announcement.  
In the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly Election, the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance secured a landslide victory, winning 235 seats. The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 132 seats, while Shiv Sena and the NCP won 57 and 41 seats, respectively.

Title: Will end naxalism in Chhattisgarh by March 2026: Amit Shah
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 11:42:46 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday reiterated the government’s commitment to eradicating maoism in Chhattisgarh by March 31, 2026. He lauded the state police for their efforts in combating Left-wing extremism over the past year.  
Speaking at an event in Raipur to commemorate the President’s Colour Award being conferred on the Chhattisgarh Police, Shah urged maoists to join the mainstream and take advantage of the state government’s surrender policy.  
“I have worked closely with the Chhattisgarh Police on anti-Naxal operations and can confidently say that they are among the most courageous forces in the country, fighting Naxals and improving the lives of citizens,” he said.  
The home minister highlighted that in the past year, 287 extremists were neutralised, nearly 1,000 arrested, and 837 surrendered. He also noted that the top 14 Naxal leaders were eliminated during this period. For the first time in four decades, fatalities among troops and civilians have dropped below 100 in a single year.  
Shah credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership for a significant reduction in violence, stating that fatalities among security forces decreased by 73%, and civilian deaths dropped by 70% over the past decade compared to the previous one.  
He added that the motto of “Viksit Chhattisgarh, Viksit Bastar” would receive a renewed push from the state police, who achieved the rare distinction of receiving the President’s Colour Award before completing 25 years of service.  
Referring to the state’s political journey, Shah recalled that when Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee established Chhattisgarh in 2000, the BJP-led government served for 15 years. “Now, with Vishnu Deo Sai as Chief Minister, I assure you that we will free Chhattisgarh from Naxalism by March 31, 2026,” he declared.  
Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai congratulated the police force on the honour and highlighted initiatives by both the central and state governments to rehabilitate surrendered extremists. These include providing 15,000 houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, financial aid, land grants for agriculture, and reservations in educational institutions for surrendered extremists and their families.  
The chief minister also detailed welfare measures for victims of Maoist violence, including technical education reservations, skill development programs for women, and land allocation for housing and agriculture.

Title: South Korea to invest $1.9 billion in tech to tackle climate change
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 11:41:30 +0000
Content: The South Korean government plans to invest 2.7 trillion won ($1.9 billion) in developing technologies to combat climate change next year, the Ministry of Science and ICT announced on Sunday.  
This represents a 3.9 percent increase from the 2.6 trillion won allocated for the initiative in 2024, according to the ministry.  
The investment forms part of the government’s 10-year plan to advance scientific technologies by 2032 in response to global warming, Yonhap News Agency reported. South Korea has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent from 2018 levels by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.  
The 2025 budget will focus on developing core renewable energy technologies, such as next-generation solar batteries and large-scale floating wind power systems. It will also prioritize advancements in carbon-neutral technologies, including next-generation nuclear power systems and hydrogen power.  
The government aims to assess the vulnerability of forests, marine areas, and ecosystems to climate change while implementing measures to ensure stable food production.  
Meanwhile, the science ministry has completed a comprehensive roadmap for achieving carbon neutrality across various industries. The Presidential Special Committee on Carbon Neutrality Technologies has devised strategies for six key sectors: wind power, energy storage, the environment, and more.  
With these guidelines, South Korea now has a comprehensive plan to develop carbon reduction technologies in 17 areas, spanning industries such as steelmaking, chemicals, car manufacturing, and nuclear power. Specific initiatives include the development of next-generation offshore wind turbines, integrated energy systems, and eco-friendly data centers.

Title: Indian SCBs post record net profit of ₹23.50 lakh crore in FY24, reduce NPAs
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 11:17:57 +0000
Content: Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) in India have achieved a significant milestone by recording the highest-ever aggregate net profit of ₹23.50 lakh crore in FY2023-24, compared to ₹22.63 lakh crore in FY2022-23, according to the Ministry of Finance.  
The asset quality of SCBs has also improved remarkably, with the gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio declining to 2.67% (₹4.75 lakh crore) in June 2024 from a peak of 11.18% (₹10.36 lakh crore) in March 2018. Public Sector Banks (PSBs) reported a similar improvement, with their gross NPA ratio dropping to 3.32% in June 2024, compared to 14.58% in March 2018 and 4.97% in March 2015.  
Additionally, the provision coverage ratio (PCR) of SCBs has risen from 49.31% in March 2015 to a robust 92.52% in June 2024, reflecting increased resilience in the banking sector.  
The Reserve Bank of India’s recent stress test results indicate that SCBs remain well-capitalized and capable of withstanding macroeconomic shocks without requiring additional capital infusion. All banks are expected to meet the minimum regulatory Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 5.5%, even under severe stress scenarios.  
PSBs recorded their highest-ever net profit of ₹1.41 lakh crore in FY2023-24, up from ₹1.05 lakh crore in FY2022-23. In the first half of FY2024-25, PSBs achieved a net profit of ₹0.86 lakh crore, underscoring their strong financial performance.

Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 08:59:56 +0000
Content: Parliamentarians under the Rajya Sabha Chairman XI and Lok Sabha Speaker XI played a friendly cricket match at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium on Sunday.  
BJP MP Anurag Thakur captained the Lok Sabha Speaker XI, while Union Minister Kiren Rijiju led the Rajya Sabha Chairman XI. The friendly match was named the “TB Mukt Bharat Awareness Cricket Match.”  
 
Speaking to ANI, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju said, “Several of our MP colleagues have come here. With the mantra of fitness, this event was scheduled to energize people through sports. I believe everyone will play with enthusiasm. Our mantra is ‘TB-Free India’ and the ‘Fit India Movement.’”
 
“Without fitness, you cannot serve the country. You must be fit both mentally and physically,” he added.  
 
“PM Modi has set the goal of making India TB-free by 2025, while the global goal is 2030. Since 2015, there has been a 38% drop in TB-related deaths in India, and an 18% reduction in new cases. This number is around 8% globally. This means India is performing better than the rest of the world”,.BJP MP Anurag Thakur said while speaking to reporters.  
 
“Despite being the most populous country, there is treatment available. The government provides free medicines and financial support of Rs 1000 for the treatment. Cases are also tracked”.
 
AAP MP Raghav Chadha praised the initiative, saying, “This is a great initiative. The match is being played for a good cause. I believe the awareness of this cause will spread to every corner of the country through this match.”  
 
“Additionally, while elections end, the animosity in the political arena between leaders continues even after that. I think that through such teamwork initiatives, animosity will be diminished, and we will work as a team for Bharat Mata to take the country forward,” Chadha said while speaking to ANI.  
 
BJP MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy felt that the MPs’ effort towards a TB-free India was unique.  
 
“This is a unique effort by MPs towards a TB-free India. The captain of our team is Anurag Thakur, who had been the Sports Minister. This is another side of MPs. Cricket is the most popular sport in the world,” he said.  
 
BJP MP Manoj Tiwari said that through this friendly match, they aim to raise awareness about TB and told reporters, “We want to give a message that we, as MPs, will still run on the field, play this match, and try to create awareness about TB. TB can be defeated with a little awareness. Who wins today’s match is a different matter, but we must defeat TB and make the country win.”  
 
Union Minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu expressed his happiness, saying, “I am very happy to participate, especially with all the MPs today. I would like to congratulate the organizers for putting together a great event. The PM has committed to defeating TB by 2025, and a series of events have been organized based on this. Today, we are taking another step forward to create more awareness in the country and unite everyone in the fight against TB.”  
 
Former India captain and Congress leader Mohammad Azharuddin remarked, “It is a joy to meet everyone like this and for MPs to get an outing like this. The country should indeed be TB-free. It should be eradicated as soon as possible. I am happy to be participating today.”  
 
BJP MP Ravi Kishan gave his take on the “historic match” while speaking to ANI, saying, “This will be a historic match. The youth must be awakened and freed from drugs and TB. We will fulfill PM Modi’s dreams when we create awareness about TB among our children.”  
 
The government’s commitment to “End TB by 2025” was first articulated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the “End TB Summit” held in New Delhi in March 2018 and was reaffirmed at the “One World TB Summit” in Varanasi on World TB Day 2023, as per an official release.
 
At this summit, the Prime Minister emphasized the need for a decisive and revitalized response to TB.

Title: PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana surpasses 6.85 lakh installations
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 08:12:21 +0000
Content: The PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana scheme has recorded over 6.85 lakh installations to date and is on track to surpass a decade’s worth of solar growth in just one year.
Launched in February this year, the scheme has already reached 86 percent of the total installations made in the previous decade, with 685,763 installations so far.
The demand was particularly high for the 3-5 kW load segment, which accounted for 77 percent of installations, while 14 percent of the installations were in the higher-than-5 kW segment. Gujarat recorded the highest number of installations, followed by Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Kerala.
Gujarat saw the maximum number of solar installations under the initiative, with 2,86,545 installations. Maharashtra followed with 1,26,344 installations, while Uttar Pradesh recorded 53,423 installations.
As of now, around 1.45 crore registrations have been completed under the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, as reported in Parliament. The scheme aims to provide solar power to one crore households by March 2027.
Launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the scheme aims to achieve one crore rooftop solar installations in the residential sector by fiscal year 2027, with a budget allocation of Rs 75,021 crore.
States like Tripura, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, and Manipur have also seen an increase in installations.
To promote the PM Solar Scheme at the grassroots level, Urban Local Bodies and Panchayats have been incentivized to encourage rooftop solar systems in their jurisdictions. The scheme is also contributing to increased income, reduced power bills, and job creation.
With the goal of benefiting one crore households, the program is expected to save the government Rs 75,000 crore annually in electricity costs.
The scheme offers a subsidy of up to 40 percent to households, making renewable energy more affordable and accessible.
The government is partnering with all stakeholders, including REC, DISCOMs, and vendors, to address any challenges and ensure the successful implementation of the scheme.

Title: Cold wave sweeps northern Odisha; Ramatirtha in Mayurbhanj records lowest temperature at -10°C
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 08:03:02 +0000
Content: A severe cold wave gripped northern Odisha on Sunday, with the Mayurbhanj district experiencing the worst of the intense chill. The Ramatirtha area in the district recorded temperatures as low as -10 degrees Celsius. 
According to the Forest Department, other areas in Mayurbhanj also reported extremely low temperatures: Gurguria and Barehipani recorded 6 degrees Celsius, Chahala 4 degrees Celsius, Nawana -5 degrees Celsius, and Upper Baraha Kamuda (UBK) -3 degrees Celsius.
On Saturday, IMD scientist Dr. Soma Sen Roy stated that the cold wave in north and central India is expected to last for one to two days, with temperatures likely to rise by December 16-17. “North-westerly winds are currently blowing, and south-easterly winds will soon follow in North India. There is a possibility of a 1-2 degree Celsius drop in temperature in Delhi. Cold wave conditions have been recorded in Punjab and Madhya Pradesh and will persist for the next one to two days,” she said.
The Meteorological Department has forecast cold wave conditions in isolated pockets of Jammu-Kashmir-Ladakh-Gilgit-Baltistan-Muzaffarabad during December 14-16, Punjab on December 15, Haryana, Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gangetic West Bengal, and Odisha on December 14-15, West Rajasthan during December 17-20, East Rajasthan during December 14-20, and Madhya Pradesh on December 16.
In Srinagar, the maximum temperature was 9 degrees Celsius, while the minimum dropped to -5 degrees Celsius, according to the IMD.
Winter has also tightened its grip on the hill town of Shimla and its surrounding regions following a fresh spell of snowfall. The icy conditions have disrupted daily life for residents, causing significant challenges.
In Delhi, a thin layer of fog covered parts of the national capital as the minimum temperature dropped to 7 degrees Celsius, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). With temperatures dipping, many sought refuge in shelter homes.
Ved Pal, who manages a shelter near AIIMS Delhi, said that food and adequate bedding are provided to those seeking shelter. “This is a family shelter where we provide proper beds and as many blankets as they need. They are also given food twice a day, along with tea and rusk in the morning,” he told ANI.
Pal added that medical facilities are also available at the shelter. “We have a first aid box, and medicines are distributed based on a doctor’s recommendations. For more serious cases, we assist residents in getting to a hospital. General medicines like paracetamol are also stocked,” he said.

Title: One Nation, One Election Bill will not be tabled in Lok Sabha on Monday
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 07:31:08 +0000
Content: The ‘One Nation, One Election’ Bill, officially titled the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2024, will not be tabled in the Lok Sabha on Monday. The revised business list for the day does not include the Bill.
The initial schedule had listed the Bill for Monday, stating: “… Arjun Ram Meghwal to move for leave to introduce a Bill further to amend the Constitution of India. Also to introduce the Bill.”
The minister was also slated to introduce The Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, which seeks to amend the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963, the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991, and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019.
The first amendment Bill proposed simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies, while the second focused on aligning assembly elections in Delhi, Jammu & Kashmir, and Puducherry.
However, with the revised list omitting these Bills, it is now speculated that the One Nation, One Election Bill will not be tabled on Monday. The winter session is scheduled to conclude on December 20, and sources suggest the Bills might be introduced later this week or through a last-minute Supplementary List of Business with the Speaker’s approval.
On Thursday, the Union Cabinet had approved the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2024, and the Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024. Both Bills were circulated to MPs on Friday evening.
The proposals are based on recommendations by a high-level committee chaired by former President Ram Nath Kovind. The committee submitted its findings in March, highlighting the challenges posed by prolonged election cycles.
The 18,626-page report, prepared over 191 days, emphasized that simultaneous elections could ensure policy stability, reduce voter fatigue, and increase electoral participation.
Following the Cabinet’s approval, several opposition leaders criticized the proposal, labeling it impractical and a threat to federalism. They raised concerns over the government’s plan to table the Bill in the ongoing winter session.
The revised business list includes The Readjustment of Representation of Scheduled Tribes in Assembly Constituencies of the State of Goa Bill, 2024. This Bill seeks to ensure the reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in Goa’s Legislative Assembly, as per Article 332 of the Constitution, and to adjust seats in light of recent changes to the Scheduled Tribes list for the state.

Title: Ukraine to set up mechanism to supply food to Syria, Zelenskiy says
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 07:30:45 +0000
Content: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday he had instructed his government to set up supply mechanisms to deliver together with international organisations and partners food to Syria in the aftermath of the fall of President Bashar al-Assad.
Ukraine has been one of the world’s top grain and oilseeds exporters, and has been exporting wheat and corn to Middle Eastern countries, but not to Syria.
Syria imported food from Russia during the Assad era, but Russian wheat supplies have been suspended amid the uncertainty and payment delays, Russian and Syrian sources said on Friday.
“We are ready to assist Syria in preventing a food crisis, particularly through the humanitarian program ‘Grain from Ukraine’,” Zelenskiy wrote on X.
“I have instructed the government to establish food supply mechanisms in cooperation with international organizations and partners who can help.”
Ukraine’s exports were buffeted by Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, which severely reduced shipments via the Black Sea. Ukraine has since broken a de facto sea blockade and revived exports from its southern ports of Odesa.

Title: Brisbane Test: Smith joins century party with Head as Australia dominate day two
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 05:44:38 +0000
Content: Steve Smith clambered out of his form slump with a drought-breaking century and Travis Head smashed another big ton as Australia posted a commanding 405 for seven on day two of the third test against India in Brisbane on Sunday.
Smith batted away questions about his place in the team with a hard-earned 101 while Head marched on to a swashbuckling 152 to the delight of most of the 34,227-strong crowd at the Gabba.
“It was nice to get in, feel good,” said Smith, who scored his 33rd test ton and first since Lord’s at the 2023 Ashes.
“I missed out for a little while now so it’s nice to get three figures again.”
It took Jasprit Bumrah to salvage something from a tough day for India, the pace spearhead taking three wickets after tea to finish the day with his 12th five-wicket haul.
Seizing the new ball, he had Smith edge to Rohit in the slips to break a 241-partnership with Head before removing all-rounder Mitchell Marsh (five) and Head in quick succession.
 
But Bumrah’s bravery also amplified India’s heavy reliance on their star quick.
 
Recalled pacer Akash Deep and spinner Ravindra Jadeja were wicketless while seamer Mohammed Siraj spent time off-field after clutching at his hamstring when bowling in the morning.
 
Alex Carey was unbeaten on 45 and Mitchell Starc was on seven at stumps, having pushed Australia past 400.
 
CHALLENGING WICKET
 
The day belonged to Head and Smith, the former backing up his match-winning 140 in the pink ball test in Adelaide and the latter posting his 10th ton against India.
Hitting Deep for a single off his pads, Smith ended his longest streak without a hundred, bringing the Gabba crowd to their feet. The 35-year-old threw an icy stare at the Australian team and kissed the crest on his helmet.
Head hurtled to three figures, hitting a Bumrah full toss for three in the final minutes before tea to bring up his ninth test ton, then flying past 150 at nearly a run a ball.
“Nice to come out and start again, build a nice partnership and be able to contribute to the day,” said Head.

Title: South Korea court begins review of Yoon impeachment over martial law attempt
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 07:25:18 +0000
Content: South Korea’s Constitutional Court on Monday began reviewing the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol over his Dec. 3 martial law attempt, starting a process to decide if he will be removed from office, while investigators plan to question him this week.
The court will hold the first public hearing on Dec. 27, spokesperson Lee Jean told a news conference, after the court’s six justices met to discuss plans for reviewing the impeachment by the opposition-controlled parliament on Saturday.
The court has up to six months to decide whether to remove Yoon from office or to reinstate him. The first hearing will be “preparatory” to confirm major legal issues of the case and schedule among other matters, Lee said.
Yoon is not required to attend that hearing, he said.
In 2017, the court took three months to issue a ruling to strip then-President Park Geun-hye’s presidency following her impeachment for abusing the powers of her office.
Yoon and a number of senior officials face potential charges of insurrection, for the short-lived martial law.
A joint team of investigators from the police, the defence ministry and an anti-corruption agency are planning to call Yoon in for questioning at 10 a.m. (0100 GMT) on Wednesday, a police official told Reuters.
Investigators tried to serve a summon for Yoon to appear by delivering it to the presidential office and his official residence, but the presidential security service declined to receive it saying it was not in the position to do so, Yonhap news said.
On Sunday Yoon did not appear in response to a summons for questioning by a separate investigation by the prosecutors’ office, Yonhap news reported. Yoon cited he was still forming a legal team for his defence as the reason, it said.
The government led by acting president, Han Duck-soo, was moving quickly to reassure international partners and calm financial markets, while the main opposition party pledged to cooperate in efforts to stabilize the situation.
Early on Monday, the finance minister, Bank of Korea governor and top financial regulators met and pledged around-the-clock monitoring of financial and foreign exchange markets.
The benchmark KOSPI index .KS11 rose for a fifth straight session on Monday and traded at its highest levels in more than two weeks, as authorities vowed to stabilize financial markets and analysts noted eased political uncertainty.
Yoon’s surprise martial law declaration and the ensuing political crisis spooked markets and South Korea’s diplomatic partners, worried over the country’s ability to deter nuclear-armed North Korea.
In one of his first moves as acting president, Han spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden by telephone on Sunday, pledging unwavering commitment to pursue foreign and security policies based on the alliance between the two countries.
Opposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung welcomed U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of his former intelligence chief to handle special missions including North Korea as a sign of commitment for dialogue to ease tensions.
Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul said the nomination of Richard Grenell indicated North Korea will be one of the top priorities of Trump’s presidency. Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on three occasions during his first term.
The Saturday impeachment vote passed with at least 12 members of Yoon’s ruling People Power Party joining in favour, which has thrown the party into a disarray with its leader Han Dong-hoon announcing his resignation on Monday.

Title: PM Modi calls for collaborative governance and innovation at 4th National Conference of Chief Secretaries
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 06:48:35 +0000
Content: Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the 4th National Conference of Chief Secretaries on Sunday, highlighting the importance of collaborative governance for realizing the vision of Viksit Bharat. The three-day conference, which took place from December 13 to 15, brought together officials from all states and Union Territories, along with experts and senior officers from the central government.
In his speech, Prime Minister Modi emphasized that the greatest benefit of the conference was the opportunity for “Team India” to engage in open dialogue and work together toward the common goal of a developed nation. He underlined that Pro-People Pro-active Good Governance (P2G2) is at the heart of the country’s efforts to achieve the vision of Viksit Bharat.
The conference, centered around the theme of ‘Promoting Entrepreneurship, Employment, and Skilling – Leveraging the Demographic Dividend,’ saw extensive discussions on how to unlock India’s potential by harnessing its demographic advantages. PM Modi praised the rise of start-ups, particularly in smaller Tier 2 and 3 cities, and encouraged states to create an environment conducive to innovation. He urged state governments to identify areas that can support entrepreneurs and take measures to connect them with financial institutions and essential logistics infrastructure.
The Prime Minister also called for the simplification of bureaucratic processes, which he said often lead to the harassment of citizens. He stressed the importance of reforming governance models to promote citizen participation, urging that states focus on reform, perform, and transform while also ensuring that citizens are well-informed about government initiatives.
On the topic of sustainability, Prime Minister Modi highlighted the success of the GOBARdhan programme, which has emerged as a key energy resource by turning waste into wealth. He urged states to explore funding opportunities for the recycling of e-waste, which is expected to rise in the future as India becomes more digitally advanced. By doing so, India can reduce its reliance on imported materials and promote a circular economy.
In the health sector, PM Modi called for greater attention to addressing obesity as part of the Fit India Movement, noting that only a fit and healthy population can contribute to building a Viksit Bharat. He also expressed confidence that India could eliminate tuberculosis by the end of 2025 and emphasized the important role that ASHA and Anganwadi workers would play in achieving this goal.
The Prime Minister also spoke about the need to digitize India’s ancient manuscripts, calling them a treasure that should be preserved through technology. He further emphasized the importance of continuously updating the PM GatiShakti platform to include indicators related to environmental impacts and disaster-prone areas, ensuring that India’s infrastructure growth remains sustainable.
PM Modi also lauded the Aspirational Districts and Blocks Programme, stressing that the right officers posted in these areas could bring about significant socio-economic changes. He called for focused human resources development to transform cities into hubs of economic growth, underscoring the importance of urban governance, water management, and adequate housing to support the increasing urban mobility.
Paying tribute to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel on his death anniversary, PM Modi hailed Patel as an inspiration for civil servants and urged them to work towards realizing his vision for a united and strong India. He also encouraged citizens to draw inspiration from the freedom movement and work towards making India a Viksit Bharat by 2047, just as they came together for independence.
The conference sessions delved into several key themes, including manufacturing, services, renewable energy, and circular economy, with a strong emphasis on women-led development as a driving force for economic transformation. Experts discussed a multifaceted approach to harnessing the potential of India’s service sector, particularly in smaller cities, and promoted rural entrepreneurship through targeted skilling programs.
A key focus of the discussions was the PRAGATI platform, designed to accelerate infrastructure development through rigorous monitoring and reviews. A special session on Frontier Technologies examined how technological convergence could provide solutions to global challenges while positioning India as a leader in inclusive and sustainable growth. Another special session, Karmayogi, focused on capacity building for civil servants, highlighting the importance of democratizing learning and strengthening citizen-centric programs.

Title: Bangladesh elections likely between late 2025 or early 2026: Dr Yunus
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 06:14:54 +0000
Content: The head of Interim Government of Bangladesh Dr Muhammad Yunus today said the next general election can be held in between the end of 2025 and the first half of 2026 after accomplishing necessary reforms.
“Broadly speaking, the election date can be set between the end of 2025 and the first half of 2026,” he said while addressing the nation this morning, marking the Victory Day. Bangladesh Television and BTV World broadcast the address of Dr Yunus.
Yunus emphasised that the timeline for the elections depends on the recommendations of the Electoral Reform Commission and the Constitution Reform Commission, which are currently conducting evaluations.
Morevere, Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), one of the major political parties of Bangladesh, has been creating pressure for the last three months on Yunus led interim government for the Election roadmap. BNP’s acting chairperson Tarique Rahman said on Sunday that people had the right to know how many more months would be needed for the interim government to reform the state. He said that if the advisers’ faces turned gloomy when asked about the election roadmap, it certainly was a sign of going against the people’s aspirations.
Earlier, BangladeshPresident Mohammed Shahabuddin today paid rich tributes to the martyrs of the 1971 Liberation War by placing a wreath at the National Memorial here, on the outskirts of Dhaka, marking the 54th Victory Day as the country was liberated from the Pakistani occupation forces.
Dr Muhammad Yunus and President of Timor-Leste Jose Ramos-Horta, who is on a state visit to Bangladesh today paid rich tributes to the martyrs by placing wreaths at the National Memorial.
The High Commission of India in Bangladesh also extended its greetings to the people of Bangladesh.

On this day in 1971, the Pakistani armed forces led by General A A K Niazi had surrendered before the Indian army and the Mukti-Bahini liberation force of Bangladesh with over 90,000 of his troops.

Title: Bangladesh celebrates Victory Day, commemorating liberation from Pakistani in 1971
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 06:01:00 +0000
Content: Bangladesh is set to celebrate the Victory Day today, the most precious day of the Bangladeshis, on December 16 as the country was liberated from the Pakistani occupation forces on that day in 1971 after a nine-month-long bloodstained War of Liberation. The nation would take a renewed pledge to translate into reality the hopes and aspirations of the War of Liberation and the dreams of the martyrs who made supreme sacrifices to liberate their beloved motherland from the Pakistani occupation forces in 1971.
Tens of thousands of people belonging to different social groups and political, cultural, professional and academic organizations and institutions are expected to throng the National Monument at Savar, near Dhaka, to pay homage to the heroes who embraced martyrdom to liberate the nation.
President Muhammad Sahabuddin is to be the first to offer wreaths at the monument amid a ceremonial honour guard while Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus is to follow him.
Political parties, socio-cultural and professional organizations and academic institutions are expected to follow them to place wreaths at the memorial.
A 31-gun salute will herald the Victory Day celebrations recalling the emergence of Bangladesh as an independent nation on the world map with the surrender of Pakistani forces.
To commemorate the Liberation War of 1971, India and Bangladesh invite each other’s War Veterans and serving officers to participate annually in each other’s Victory Day celebrations, said the High Commission of India in Bangladesh through an official facebook post.

Title: China’s fragile recovery: industrial gains, sluggish retail, and stimulus pressure as U.S. tariffs loom
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 06:00:03 +0000
Content: China’s industrial output growth quickened slightly in November, while retail sales disappointed, keeping pressure on Beijing to ramp up stimulus for a fragile economy as it braces for more U.S. trade tariffs under a second Trump administration.
The mixed set of data underlines the challenges facing Chinese leaders heading into 2025 when trade relations with the United States could worsen at a time when domestic consumption also remains weak.
“China’s economy appears to have slowed last month, despite tailwinds from recent policy easing,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics.
“But we doubt that stimulus can deliver anything more than a short-lived improvement, not least because the current strength of export demand is unlikely to last once President Trump starts to put some of his tariff threats into action.”
China’s industrial output grew 5.4% in November year-on-year, up from the 5.3% pace seen in October, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Monday, beating expectations for a 5.3% increase in a Reuters poll.
However, retail sales, a gauge of consumption, grew just 3.3% last month, much slower than a 4.8% rise seen in October. Analysts had predicted a 4.6% expansion.
The weaker retail figures come despite a boost from major online shopping promotions and government-subsidised trade-in programs that have boosted sales in sectors including automobiles.
Fixed asset investment also increased at a slower 3.3% pace in January-November from the same period a year earlier, compared with an expected 3.4% rise. It grew 3.4% in the January to October period.
NBS spokesperson Fu Linghui told a media briefing that the trend of recovery in consumption has not changed and that more efforts would be needed to ensure the economic recovery continues into 2025.
At last week’s Central Economic Work Conference (CEWC), a closely-watched agenda-setting meeting, China’s top leaders pledged to raise the budget deficit, issue more debt, and make boosting consumption a top priority.
The remarks echoed commitments made by a meeting of top Communist Party officials, the Politburo, earlier this month, which endorsed an “appropriately loose” monetary policy in the first easing of its stance in 14 years.
Policymakers continue to grapple with a years-long property crisis that is dragging on consumer confidence and the broader economy, with some 70% of household savings parked in real estate.
There was some encouraging signs on China’s new home prices, which fell at the slowest pace in 17 months in November.
Officials in recent months have doubled down on efforts to encourage homebuying, including cutting mortgage rates and minimum down-payment ratios, as well as tax incentives to lower the cost of housing transactions.
However, most analysts say a sure-footed recovery in the real estate sector appears to be some way off.
Reuters has reported that policy advisers have recommended that Beijing maintain a growth target of around 5.0% for next year, with one government economist saying that China can offset the impact of expected U.S. tariffs on its exports by further boosting domestic demand.
Trump, who is set to start his second term as the U.S. president in January, has threatened tariffs in excess of 60% on imports of Chinese goods.
Reuters also reported last week that China was considering allowing the yuan to weaken in response to punitive trade measures, but a readout from state media Xinhua after the CEWC reiterated a commitment to maintain the yuan’s basic stability.
A recent Reuters poll predicted China will grow 4.5% next year, with new U.S. tariffs potentially shaving up to 1 parentage point off growth.

Title: Indian share market opens lower, auto and IT stocks drag
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 05:45:05 +0000
Content: The Indian stock market opened in the red on Monday, with selling pressure observed in Nifty’s auto, IT, PSU bank, pharma, and metal sectors.
At around 9:32 am, the Sensex was trading at 81,876.95, down by 256.17 points or 0.31%, while the Nifty was at 24,705.60, declining by 62.70 points or 0.25%.
Despite the decline, the market trend remained broadly positive. On the National Stock Exchange (NSE), 1,170 stocks were trading in the green, while 571 stocks were in the red.
Akshay Chinchalkar of Axis Securities commented on Friday’s highly volatile session, stating that the Nifty slumped during the early part of the session, “but the day’s low occurred exactly at the falling neckline of the bullish head-and-shoulders pattern, which was activated on December 3 with an upside objective of 25,500.”
He added, “This objective remains valid as long as the market stays above 23,873, but more critical support now is Friday’s low of 24,180.”
Nifty Bank was down 168 points or 0.31%, trading at 53,415.80. The Nifty Midcap 100 index rose by 243.30 points or 0.41%, trading at 59,234.85, while the Nifty Smallcap 100 index was up 108.10 points or 0.56%, at 19,515.40.
According to market experts, the heightened volatility in the market can be attributed to large positions in the F&O (Futures & Options) segments. The 500-point move in the Nifty from the day’s trough to its peak suggests massive short-covering activity.
In the Sensex pack, NTPC, JSW Steel, M&M, Titan, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Infosys, TCS, Hindustan Unilever Limited, Axis Bank, and Tech Mahindra were among the top losers. On the other hand, Tata Steel, UltraTech Cement, L&T, ITC, Tata Motors, IndusInd Bank, and HCL Tech emerged as the top gainers.
In Asian markets, except for China, indices in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Seoul, Jakarta, and Japan were trading in the red.
Meanwhile, in the US stock markets, the Nasdaq Composite closed 0.12% higher, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.20% lower in the previous trading session.
Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) bought equities worth Rs 2,335.32 crore on December 13, while Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) sold equities worth Rs 732.20 crore on the same day.

Title: Israel approves $11.13 million settlement expansion in Golan Heights
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 05:39:35 +0000
Content: The Israeli government has unanimously approved a comprehensive plan to expand settlements in the occupied Golan Heights, allocating more than $11.13 million to the initiative. The decision, announced Sunday, comes amid heightened regional tensions following recent political upheaval in Syria.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who proposed the plan, cited security concerns along Israel’s border with Syria as justification, pointing to what he called a “new front” following the fall of the Assad regime this month. The expansion initiative includes funding for education, renewable energy projects, a student village, and organizational development support for the Golan Regional Council to accommodate an influx of new residents.
Currently, the occupied Syrian Golan Heights has a population of approximately 50,000, evenly split between Israeli settlers and a mix of Druze, Alawite, and other communities. The new plan aims to significantly increase the Israeli settler presence in the region.
The announcement has triggered swift condemnation from multiple Arab nations. The United Arab Emirates denounced the decision through its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reaffirming its commitment to Syria’s territorial integrity and warning of potential regional escalation. Qatar characterized the move as “a new chapter in a series of Israeli attacks on Syrian territories,” urging international intervention to halt the expansion. Saudi Arabia added its voice to the growing opposition, explicitly condemning the settlement plan.
The Golan Heights, captured by Israel during the 1967 Six-Day War and annexed in 1981, remains classified as occupied territory under international law. The United States stands alone in recognizing Israel’s annexation of the region, with the international community broadly rejecting Israeli sovereignty over the area.

Title: Israeli forces carry out air, ground attacks in Gaza; dozens dead
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 05:26:59 +0000
Content: Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least 53 Palestinians, including a journalist and rescue workers, medics said, and the Israeli military said its air and ground forces in the north of the enclave killed dozens of militants and captured others.
An airstrike hit the civil emergency centre in the Nuseirat market area in the central Gaza Strip, killing Ahmed Al-Louh, a video journalist for Al Jazeera TV, and five other people, medics and fellow journalists said. Another strike on a house in Nuseirat camp killed five people, including children, according to medics.
The TV network said Al-Louh was working when he was killed and condemned Israel.
The Israeli military said the strike had targeted Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants operating from Gaza’s Civil Defence’s Nuseirat office. It named Al-Louh as a member of the militant group Islamic Jihad, without providing evidence.
Al Jazeera did not immediately comment on the Israeli allegation but has condemned previous claims by Israel naming some of the Qatari-owned network’s journalists killed in the Gaza war as members of militant groups.
Hamas media said the head of the civil emergency service in Nuseirat, Nedal Abu Hjayyer, was also killed.
“The civil emergency headquarters in Nuseirat camp was hit during the crews’ presence, they work around the clock to serve the people,” said Zaki Emadeldeen from the civil emergency service to reporters at the hospital.
Another airstrike hit a group of Hamas-linked men tasked with protecting aid trucks west of Gaza City, and medics said several were hurt but exact figures were unavailable.
At least 11 people were killed in three Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City houses, nine were killed in the towns of Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia camp when clusters of houses were bombed or set ablaze, and two were killed in Rafah, medics and residents said.
The Israeli military said the three Gaza City houses belonged to militants planning imminent attacks. It said steps were taken to reduce risk to civilians, including the use of precise munitions and aerial surveillance.
The military issued a photo showing the weapons it seized in Beit Lahiya that included explosives and dozens of grenades.
In southern Gaza’s Khan Younis, medics said that at least 20 people, including women and children, were killed when an airstrike hit a shelter housing displaced families.
In Beit Hanoun, residents said Israeli forces besieged families sheltering in Khalil Aweida school before storming it and ordering them to head towards Gaza City.
Medics said several people were killed and wounded during the raid while the army detained many men.
The military said it struck dozens of militants from the air and on the ground and captured others in Beit Hanoun.
Reuters was unable to confirm whether any of the people killed were fighters. Hamas does not disclose its casualties, and the Palestinian health ministry does not distinguish in its death toll between combatants and non-combatants.
Israel says Gaza’s militants regularly embed among civilians, using them as human shields. Hamas denies this.
HOSTAGES
Separately, Israel said aircraft struck a command and control centre in a compound in the Abu Shabak clinic in northern Gaza used by Hamas to store weapons and plan attacks. The Gaza health ministry said the medical center was destroyed.
Palestinians accuse Israel of carrying out ethnic cleansing to depopulate Gaza’s northern edge to create a buffer zone. Israel denies this and says the campaign targets Hamas militants. The military says it has instructed civilians to evacuate battle zones for their own safety.
The war began when the Palestinian militant group Hamas stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli authorities.
Israel then launched an air and land offensive that has killed almost 45,000 people, mostly civilians, according to authorities in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. The campaign has displaced nearly the entire population and left much of the enclave in ruins.
A bid by Egypt, Qatar and the United States to reach a truce, which would also include a hostage deal, has gained momentum in recent weeks, yet there has been no news of a breakthrough.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had spoken with U.S. President-elect Trump, who returns to the White House on Jan. 20, about efforts to secure a hostage release.
“We discussed the need to complete Israel’s victory and we spoke at length about the efforts we are making to free our hostages,” Netanyahu said in a statement on Sunday.

Title: Rajya Sabha to hold discussion on Constitution from today
Publication Date: Mon, 16 Dec 2024 05:16:26 +0000
Content: After a fiery debate over the Constitution in the Lok Sabha, the Rajya Sabha is set to discuss the topic on Monday and Tuesday.
As per the list of business of the Upper House, there will be a “discussion on the glorious journey of the 75 years of the Constitution of India”.
Before the discussion begins, an obituary reference will be made on the passing away of ex-Member Shreegopal Vyas, papers will be laid on the table by eight ministers, and various Standing Committees will also submit their reports.
The debate in the Rajya Sabha comes amid escalating tensions over a no-confidence motion filed by the Congress-led opposition against Vice President and House Chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar.
Last week, the Upper House saw uproar and adjournments over the no-trust motion against Dhankhar. The opposition’s motion accuses him of biased conduct.
The Rajya Sabha debate on the Constitution comes after a two-day discussion in the Lok Sabha. Defence Minister Rajnath Singh initiated the two-day debate with a focus on its historical significance and role in shaping the nation’s governance and global standing.
Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in her maiden speech in Parliament, said the BJP would have changed the Constitution had it not been for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. Leader of Opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi made references to Veer Savarkar which were objected to by the BJP members.
The highlight of the two-day discussion in the Lower House was Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech. He said the Constitutional amendments brought by his government weren’t done to tighten grip on power, in contrast with the Congress. He said the Nehru-Gandhi family had made a habit of amending the Constitution as it suited their interests, starting with the country’s first PM Jawaharlal Nehru.
PM Modi also outlined 11 resolutions for the country’s future. He said, “After being inspired by the inherent spirit of the Constitution, I want to present 11 resolutions in front of the Parliament for the future of the country.”
