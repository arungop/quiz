Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 13:00:20 +0000
Content: Leaders of the Mahayuti alliance were sworn in as cabinet ministers in the Maharashtra government during a ceremony at Raj Bhavan in Nagpur on Sunday.  
The Mahayuti alliance comprises the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and the Shiv Sena. 
BJP leaders, including state unit chief Chandrashekhar Bawankule, Ashish Shelar, Ganesh Naik, Mangal Prabhat Lodha, Pankaja Munde, Girish Mahajan, Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, Chandrakant Patil, and Nitesh Rane, took the oath of office.  
Representing Shiv Sena’s Eknath Shinde faction, leaders such as Shambhuraj Desai, Dadaji Dagadu Bhuse, Sanjay Rathod, Uday Samant, Gulabrao Patil, and Sanjay Shirsat were also sworn in. Additionally, NCP leaders Aditi Tatkare, Dhananjay Munde, and Hasan Mushrif joined the Cabinet.  
Maharashtra Governor CP Radhakrishnan administered the oath to the newly inducted ministers, in the presence of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Deputy Chief Ministers Eknath Shinde and Ajit Pawar.  
This Cabinet expansion occurred over two weeks after CM Fadnavis and his two deputies were sworn in on December 5. The Mahayuti alliance, which commands a significant majority in the Assembly, had faced criticism from the opposition for delaying the Cabinet announcement.  
In the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly Election, the BJP-led Mahayuti alliance secured a landslide victory, winning 235 seats. The BJP emerged as the single largest party with 132 seats, while Shiv Sena and the NCP won 57 and 41 seats, respectively.

Title: Will end naxalism in Chhattisgarh by March 2026: Amit Shah
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 11:42:46 +0000
Content: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Sunday reiterated the government’s commitment to eradicating maoism in Chhattisgarh by March 31, 2026. He lauded the state police for their efforts in combating Left-wing extremism over the past year.  
Speaking at an event in Raipur to commemorate the President’s Colour Award being conferred on the Chhattisgarh Police, Shah urged maoists to join the mainstream and take advantage of the state government’s surrender policy.  
“I have worked closely with the Chhattisgarh Police on anti-Naxal operations and can confidently say that they are among the most courageous forces in the country, fighting Naxals and improving the lives of citizens,” he said.  
The home minister highlighted that in the past year, 287 extremists were neutralised, nearly 1,000 arrested, and 837 surrendered. He also noted that the top 14 Naxal leaders were eliminated during this period. For the first time in four decades, fatalities among troops and civilians have dropped below 100 in a single year.  
Shah credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership for a significant reduction in violence, stating that fatalities among security forces decreased by 73%, and civilian deaths dropped by 70% over the past decade compared to the previous one.  
He added that the motto of “Viksit Chhattisgarh, Viksit Bastar” would receive a renewed push from the state police, who achieved the rare distinction of receiving the President’s Colour Award before completing 25 years of service.  
Referring to the state’s political journey, Shah recalled that when Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee established Chhattisgarh in 2000, the BJP-led government served for 15 years. “Now, with Vishnu Deo Sai as Chief Minister, I assure you that we will free Chhattisgarh from Naxalism by March 31, 2026,” he declared.  
Chief Minister Vishnu Deo Sai congratulated the police force on the honour and highlighted initiatives by both the central and state governments to rehabilitate surrendered extremists. These include providing 15,000 houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana, financial aid, land grants for agriculture, and reservations in educational institutions for surrendered extremists and their families.  
The chief minister also detailed welfare measures for victims of Maoist violence, including technical education reservations, skill development programs for women, and land allocation for housing and agriculture.

Title: South Korea to invest $1.9 billion in tech to tackle climate change
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 11:41:30 +0000
Content: The South Korean government plans to invest 2.7 trillion won ($1.9 billion) in developing technologies to combat climate change next year, the Ministry of Science and ICT announced on Sunday.  
This represents a 3.9 percent increase from the 2.6 trillion won allocated for the initiative in 2024, according to the ministry.  
The investment forms part of the government’s 10-year plan to advance scientific technologies by 2032 in response to global warming, Yonhap News Agency reported. South Korea has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent from 2018 levels by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.  
The 2025 budget will focus on developing core renewable energy technologies, such as next-generation solar batteries and large-scale floating wind power systems. It will also prioritize advancements in carbon-neutral technologies, including next-generation nuclear power systems and hydrogen power.  
The government aims to assess the vulnerability of forests, marine areas, and ecosystems to climate change while implementing measures to ensure stable food production.  
Meanwhile, the science ministry has completed a comprehensive roadmap for achieving carbon neutrality across various industries. The Presidential Special Committee on Carbon Neutrality Technologies has devised strategies for six key sectors: wind power, energy storage, the environment, and more.  
With these guidelines, South Korea now has a comprehensive plan to develop carbon reduction technologies in 17 areas, spanning industries such as steelmaking, chemicals, car manufacturing, and nuclear power. Specific initiatives include the development of next-generation offshore wind turbines, integrated energy systems, and eco-friendly data centers.

Title: Indian SCBs post record net profit of ₹23.50 lakh crore in FY24, reduce NPAs
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 11:17:57 +0000
Content: Scheduled Commercial Banks (SCBs) in India have achieved a significant milestone by recording the highest-ever aggregate net profit of ₹23.50 lakh crore in FY2023-24, compared to ₹22.63 lakh crore in FY2022-23, according to the Ministry of Finance.  
The asset quality of SCBs has also improved remarkably, with the gross non-performing asset (NPA) ratio declining to 2.67% (₹4.75 lakh crore) in June 2024 from a peak of 11.18% (₹10.36 lakh crore) in March 2018. Public Sector Banks (PSBs) reported a similar improvement, with their gross NPA ratio dropping to 3.32% in June 2024, compared to 14.58% in March 2018 and 4.97% in March 2015.  
Additionally, the provision coverage ratio (PCR) of SCBs has risen from 49.31% in March 2015 to a robust 92.52% in June 2024, reflecting increased resilience in the banking sector.  
The Reserve Bank of India’s recent stress test results indicate that SCBs remain well-capitalized and capable of withstanding macroeconomic shocks without requiring additional capital infusion. All banks are expected to meet the minimum regulatory Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 5.5%, even under severe stress scenarios.  
PSBs recorded their highest-ever net profit of ₹1.41 lakh crore in FY2023-24, up from ₹1.05 lakh crore in FY2022-23. In the first half of FY2024-25, PSBs achieved a net profit of ₹0.86 lakh crore, underscoring their strong financial performance.

Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 08:59:56 +0000
Content: Parliamentarians under the Rajya Sabha Chairman XI and Lok Sabha Speaker XI played a friendly cricket match at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium on Sunday.  
BJP MP Anurag Thakur captained the Lok Sabha Speaker XI, while Union Minister Kiren Rijiju led the Rajya Sabha Chairman XI. The friendly match was named the “TB Mukt Bharat Awareness Cricket Match.”  
 
Speaking to ANI, Union Minister Kiren Rijiju said, “Several of our MP colleagues have come here. With the mantra of fitness, this event was scheduled to energize people through sports. I believe everyone will play with enthusiasm. Our mantra is ‘TB-Free India’ and the ‘Fit India Movement.’”
 
“Without fitness, you cannot serve the country. You must be fit both mentally and physically,” he added.  
 
“PM Modi has set the goal of making India TB-free by 2025, while the global goal is 2030. Since 2015, there has been a 38% drop in TB-related deaths in India, and an 18% reduction in new cases. This number is around 8% globally. This means India is performing better than the rest of the world”,.BJP MP Anurag Thakur said while speaking to reporters.  
 
“Despite being the most populous country, there is treatment available. The government provides free medicines and financial support of Rs 1000 for the treatment. Cases are also tracked”.
 
AAP MP Raghav Chadha praised the initiative, saying, “This is a great initiative. The match is being played for a good cause. I believe the awareness of this cause will spread to every corner of the country through this match.”  
 
“Additionally, while elections end, the animosity in the political arena between leaders continues even after that. I think that through such teamwork initiatives, animosity will be diminished, and we will work as a team for Bharat Mata to take the country forward,” Chadha said while speaking to ANI.  
 
BJP MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy felt that the MPs’ effort towards a TB-free India was unique.  
 
“This is a unique effort by MPs towards a TB-free India. The captain of our team is Anurag Thakur, who had been the Sports Minister. This is another side of MPs. Cricket is the most popular sport in the world,” he said.  
 
BJP MP Manoj Tiwari said that through this friendly match, they aim to raise awareness about TB and told reporters, “We want to give a message that we, as MPs, will still run on the field, play this match, and try to create awareness about TB. TB can be defeated with a little awareness. Who wins today’s match is a different matter, but we must defeat TB and make the country win.”  
 
Union Minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu expressed his happiness, saying, “I am very happy to participate, especially with all the MPs today. I would like to congratulate the organizers for putting together a great event. The PM has committed to defeating TB by 2025, and a series of events have been organized based on this. Today, we are taking another step forward to create more awareness in the country and unite everyone in the fight against TB.”  
 
Former India captain and Congress leader Mohammad Azharuddin remarked, “It is a joy to meet everyone like this and for MPs to get an outing like this. The country should indeed be TB-free. It should be eradicated as soon as possible. I am happy to be participating today.”  
 
BJP MP Ravi Kishan gave his take on the “historic match” while speaking to ANI, saying, “This will be a historic match. The youth must be awakened and freed from drugs and TB. We will fulfill PM Modi’s dreams when we create awareness about TB among our children.”  
 
The government’s commitment to “End TB by 2025” was first articulated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the “End TB Summit” held in New Delhi in March 2018 and was reaffirmed at the “One World TB Summit” in Varanasi on World TB Day 2023, as per an official release.
 
At this summit, the Prime Minister emphasized the need for a decisive and revitalized response to TB. 
 
India is a signatory to the Gandhinagar Declaration, a joint declaration by the Health Ministers and WHO South-East Asian Regional Office (SEARO), which was signed at the high-level ministerial meeting on “Sustain, Accelerate, and Innovate to End TB” in the South-East Asia Region by 2030 in August 2023.

Title: PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana surpasses 6.85 lakh installations
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 08:12:21 +0000
Content: The PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana scheme has recorded over 6.85 lakh installations to date and is on track to surpass a decade’s worth of solar growth in just one year.
Launched in February this year, the scheme has already reached 86 percent of the total installations made in the previous decade, with 685,763 installations so far.
The demand was particularly high for the 3-5 kW load segment, which accounted for 77 percent of installations, while 14 percent of the installations were in the higher-than-5 kW segment. Gujarat recorded the highest number of installations, followed by Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, and Kerala.
Gujarat saw the maximum number of solar installations under the initiative, with 2,86,545 installations. Maharashtra followed with 1,26,344 installations, while Uttar Pradesh recorded 53,423 installations.
As of now, around 1.45 crore registrations have been completed under the PM Surya Ghar Muft Bijli Yojana, as reported in Parliament. The scheme aims to provide solar power to one crore households by March 2027.
Launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the scheme aims to achieve one crore rooftop solar installations in the residential sector by fiscal year 2027, with a budget allocation of Rs 75,021 crore.
States like Tripura, Jharkhand, Arunachal Pradesh, and Manipur have also seen an increase in installations.
To promote the PM Solar Scheme at the grassroots level, Urban Local Bodies and Panchayats have been incentivized to encourage rooftop solar systems in their jurisdictions. The scheme is also contributing to increased income, reduced power bills, and job creation.
With the goal of benefiting one crore households, the program is expected to save the government Rs 75,000 crore annually in electricity costs.
The scheme offers a subsidy of up to 40 percent to households, making renewable energy more affordable and accessible.
The government is partnering with all stakeholders, including REC, DISCOMs, and vendors, to address any challenges and ensure the successful implementation of the scheme.

Title: Cold wave sweeps northern Odisha; Ramatirtha in Mayurbhanj records lowest temperature at -10°C
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 08:03:02 +0000
Content: A severe cold wave gripped northern Odisha on Sunday, with the Mayurbhanj district experiencing the worst of the intense chill. The Ramatirtha area in the district recorded temperatures as low as -10 degrees Celsius. 
According to the Forest Department, other areas in Mayurbhanj also reported extremely low temperatures: Gurguria and Barehipani recorded 6 degrees Celsius, Chahala 4 degrees Celsius, Nawana -5 degrees Celsius, and Upper Baraha Kamuda (UBK) -3 degrees Celsius.
On Saturday, IMD scientist Dr. Soma Sen Roy stated that the cold wave in north and central India is expected to last for one to two days, with temperatures likely to rise by December 16-17. “North-westerly winds are currently blowing, and south-easterly winds will soon follow in North India. There is a possibility of a 1-2 degree Celsius drop in temperature in Delhi. Cold wave conditions have been recorded in Punjab and Madhya Pradesh and will persist for the next one to two days,” she said.
The Meteorological Department has forecast cold wave conditions in isolated pockets of Jammu-Kashmir-Ladakh-Gilgit-Baltistan-Muzaffarabad during December 14-16, Punjab on December 15, Haryana, Chandigarh, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gangetic West Bengal, and Odisha on December 14-15, West Rajasthan during December 17-20, East Rajasthan during December 14-20, and Madhya Pradesh on December 16.
In Srinagar, the maximum temperature was 9 degrees Celsius, while the minimum dropped to -5 degrees Celsius, according to the IMD.
Winter has also tightened its grip on the hill town of Shimla and its surrounding regions following a fresh spell of snowfall. The icy conditions have disrupted daily life for residents, causing significant challenges.
In Delhi, a thin layer of fog covered parts of the national capital as the minimum temperature dropped to 7 degrees Celsius, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). With temperatures dipping, many sought refuge in shelter homes.
Ved Pal, who manages a shelter near AIIMS Delhi, said that food and adequate bedding are provided to those seeking shelter. “This is a family shelter where we provide proper beds and as many blankets as they need. They are also given food twice a day, along with tea and rusk in the morning,” he told ANI.

Title: One Nation, One Election Bill will not be tabled in Lok Sabha on Monday
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 07:31:08 +0000
Content: The ‘One Nation, One Election’ Bill, officially titled the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2024, will not be tabled in the Lok Sabha on Monday. The revised business list for the day does not include the Bill.
The initial schedule had listed the Bill for Monday, stating: “… Arjun Ram Meghwal to move for leave to introduce a Bill further to amend the Constitution of India. Also to introduce the Bill.”
The minister was also slated to introduce The Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024, which seeks to amend the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963, the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991, and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019.
The first amendment Bill proposed simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and State Assemblies, while the second focused on aligning assembly elections in Delhi, Jammu & Kashmir, and Puducherry.
However, with the revised list omitting these Bills, it is now speculated that the One Nation, One Election Bill will not be tabled on Monday. The winter session is scheduled to conclude on December 20, and sources suggest the Bills might be introduced later this week or through a last-minute Supplementary List of Business with the Speaker’s approval.
On Thursday, the Union Cabinet had approved the Constitution (One Hundred and Twenty-Ninth Amendment) Bill, 2024, and the Union Territories Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2024. Both Bills were circulated to MPs on Friday evening.
The proposals are based on recommendations by a high-level committee chaired by former President Ram Nath Kovind. The committee submitted its findings in March, highlighting the challenges posed by prolonged election cycles.
The 18,626-page report, prepared over 191 days, emphasized that simultaneous elections could ensure policy stability, reduce voter fatigue, and increase electoral participation.
Following the Cabinet’s approval, several opposition leaders criticized the proposal, labeling it impractical and a threat to federalism. They raised concerns over the government’s plan to table the Bill in the ongoing winter session.
The revised business list includes The Readjustment of Representation of Scheduled Tribes in Assembly Constituencies of the State of Goa Bill, 2024. This Bill seeks to ensure the reservation of seats for Scheduled Tribes in Goa’s Legislative Assembly, as per Article 332 of the Constitution, and to adjust seats in light of recent changes to the Scheduled Tribes list for the state.

Title: Ukraine to set up mechanism to supply food to Syria, Zelenskiy says
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 07:30:45 +0000
Content: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday he had instructed his government to set up supply mechanisms to deliver together with international organisations and partners food to Syria in the aftermath of the fall of President Bashar al-Assad.
Ukraine has been one of the world’s top grain and oilseeds exporters, and has been exporting wheat and corn to Middle Eastern countries, but not to Syria.
Syria imported food from Russia during the Assad era, but Russian wheat supplies have been suspended amid the uncertainty and payment delays, Russian and Syrian sources said on Friday.
“We are ready to assist Syria in preventing a food crisis, particularly through the humanitarian program ‘Grain from Ukraine’,” Zelenskiy wrote on X.
“I have instructed the government to establish food supply mechanisms in cooperation with international organizations and partners who can help.”
Ukraine’s exports were buffeted by Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, which severely reduced shipments via the Black Sea. Ukraine has since broken a de facto sea blockade and revived exports from its southern ports of Odesa.

Title: Brisbane Test: Smith joins century party with Head as Australia dominate day two
Publication Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2024 05:44:38 +0000
Content: Steve Smith clambered out of his form slump with a drought-breaking century and Travis Head smashed another big ton as Australia posted a commanding 405 for seven on day two of the third test against India in Brisbane on Sunday.
Smith batted away questions about his place in the team with a hard-earned 101 while Head marched on to a swashbuckling 152 to the delight of most of the 34,227-strong crowd at the Gabba.
“It was nice to get in, feel good,” said Smith, who scored his 33rd test ton and first since Lord’s at the 2023 Ashes.
“I missed out for a little while now so it’s nice to get three figures again.”
It took Jasprit Bumrah to salvage something from a tough day for India, the pace spearhead taking three wickets after tea to finish the day with his 12th five-wicket haul.
Seizing the new ball, he had Smith edge to Rohit in the slips to break a 241-partnership with Head before removing all-rounder Mitchell Marsh (five) and Head in quick succession.
 
But Bumrah’s bravery also amplified India’s heavy reliance on their star quick.
 
Recalled pacer Akash Deep and spinner Ravindra Jadeja were wicketless while seamer Mohammed Siraj spent time off-field after clutching at his hamstring when bowling in the morning.
 
Alex Carey was unbeaten on 45 and Mitchell Starc was on seven at stumps, having pushed Australia past 400.
 
CHALLENGING WICKET
 
The day belonged to Head and Smith, the former backing up his match-winning 140 in the pink ball test in Adelaide and the latter posting his 10th ton against India.
Hitting Deep for a single off his pads, Smith ended his longest streak without a hundred, bringing the Gabba crowd to their feet. The 35-year-old threw an icy stare at the Australian team and kissed the crest on his helmet.
Head hurtled to three figures, hitting a Bumrah full toss for three in the final minutes before tea to bring up his ninth test ton, then flying past 150 at nearly a run a ball.
“Nice to come out and start again, build a nice partnership and be able to contribute to the day,” said Head.
